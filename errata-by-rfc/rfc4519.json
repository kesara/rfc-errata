Simply put, there was insufficient support of the suggested change at that time.\r\n\r\nThe change is also bad in that in removes one of the examples of multiple listed attributes, a rarely used but still valid (for historical reasons) of X.500/LDAP schema descriptions, and hence may lead to implementations not supporting this feature and by doing so causing interop problems.\r\n",
