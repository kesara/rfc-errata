The service level associated with a\r\n   given LSP is mapped to one or more P&R schemes during LSP\r\n   establishment.  An advantage that mapping is that an LSP may use\r\n   different P&E schemes in different segments of a network (e.g., some\r\n   links may be span protected, whilst other segments of the LSP may\r\n   utilize ring protection).  These details are likely to be service\r\n   provider specific.\r\n",
