    "notes": "This is based on an email I received from Anil Kumar of Nokia (anil.kumar_t_v@nokia.com).\r\n\r\nThe language as originally written made a session timeout a no-op when in Down state.  This was a gratuitous attempt to avoid a null state transition, but had the side effect of not setting the diag code (and otherwise is no different).\r\n\r\nThis turns out to be problematic in the case where system \"A\" signals AdminDown, causing system \"B\" to respond with Down state.  If the link then fails, the existing verbiage implies that \"B\" will not report the detection timeout, even locally.\r\n\r\nIf the link fails in a unidirectional manner (such that \"B\" is deaf), B will give no indication of a timeout in its outgoing Control packets back to A (which can in fact hear them).\r\n\r\nMaking the suggested change should ensure that the diagnostic code is always set to Detection Time Expired when Control packets stop arriving, even if the far end system was previously reporting AdminDown.",
