",
    "notes": "Virtual links become inoperational in case path metric between two endpoints is > 0xffff. Path metric of two or more links, one of which has MaxLinkMetric, will inevitably exceed value 0xffff.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   The suggested text is technically correct, however it is really providing additional information rather than an actual errata.   If this RFC is revised, then a discussion with the working group would be appropriate.",
