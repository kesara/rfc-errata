All 4\r\n   bits are used to indicate whether VT1.5 (T1) tributaries are carried\r\n|  within a VTG.  The first 3 bits read from right to left are used to\r\n   indicate whether VT2 (E1) tributaries are carried within a VTG.  The\r\n|  first 2 bits are used to indicate whether VT3 (DS1C) tributaries are\r\n|  carried within a VTG.  The rightmost bit is used to indicate whether\r\n   a VT6 (DS2) is carried within the VTG.  The VTs within the VTG are\r\n   numbered from right to left, starting from the first VT as the first\r\n   bit on the right.  For example, the EBM of a fully occupied STS-1\r\n<< page break >>>\r\n   with VT1.5 tributaries is all ones, while that of an STS-1 fully\r\n   occupied with VT2 (E1) tributaries has the binary value\r\n|  0111011101110111011101110111.\r\n\r\nOoops!\r\n\r\na)\r\nIf you have a numbered bit field, e.g., the VTG7 field:\r\n\r\n       0 1 2 3 4 5\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-\r\n      |  VTG7 |  ...\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-\r\n\r\nand denote the binary representation of its value accordingly:\r\n         <vtg7> = < b0, b1, b2, b3 >,\r\nthen \"The *first* 3 bits read from right to left\", apparently\r\nspecifies the number with the (bit-reversed) binary representation\r\n                  < b2, b1, b0 > .\r\n\r\nThat does not correspond to the final example given, and it is not\r\nreally compatible with the last sentence before the page break.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, \"the first 2 bits\" used for VT3 / DS1C would be\r\n  < b0, b1 >  -- or should it be (again, bit-revered)  < b1, b0 >  ??\r\n\r\nFinally, \"the rightmost bit\" is used for VT6 / DS2, i.e.  < b3 > .\r\n\r\nThat seems fuzzy, at best.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the example is correct, I strongly suspect that the\r\n'active' bit groups are intended to be right justified in the 4-bit\r\ngroups, in any case, und that thus text above in fact should say:\r\n\r\n   The 28 bits of the EBM are divided into groups of 4 bits, each\r\n   corresponding to a different VTG within the STS container.  All 4\r\n   bits are used to indicate whether VT1.5 (T1) tributaries are carried\r\n|  within a VTG.  The 3 rightmost bits in a bit group are used to\r\n|  indicate whether VT2 (E1) tributaries are carried within a VTG.\r\n|  The 2 rightmost bits in a bit group are used to indicate whether\r\n|  VT3 (DS1C) tributaries are carried within a VTG.  The rightmost bit\r\n   is used to indicate whether a VT6 (DS2) is carried within the VTG.\r\n   The VTs within the VTG are numbered from right to left, starting from\r\n   the first VT as the first bit on the right.  [...]\r\n\r\nb)\r\nFurther confusion arises from the fact that the above specification\r\noverloads the field in a four-fold way but does not give any hint\r\nas to how this overloading is encoded / disambiguated.\r\n\r\nI've scratched my head for quite a time, looking for the appropriate\r\nhooks to properly decode the field.\r\nMuch later in the text, it eventually turns out that this information\r\nmust be signalled out-of-band.\r\n\r\nFor clarity and precision, this fact should have been stated clearly\r\nwithin Section 11.2.1.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  Section 11.2.1.2\r\n\r\nThere's a mismatch in the notation between the formula given in\r\nSection 11.2.1.2, on mid-page 24, and the subsequent explanations.\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n                                                           vvv\r\n|     B3[i]'(t) = B3[i](t-1) || B3[i]'(t-1) || B3[i](t) || B*3[i](t-1)\r\n\r\n|     Where:\r\n\r\n         B3[i]   = the existing B3[i] value in the incoming signal\r\n         B3[i]'  = the new (compensated) B3[i] value\r\n|        B3*[i]  = the B3[i] value of the unequipped VTs in the\r\n                   incoming signal\r\n         ||  =  exclusive OR operator\r\n         t   =  the time of the current frame\r\n         t-1 =  the time of the previous frame\r\n\r\nIMHO, the notation 'B3*[i]' , as explained is the proper notation,\r\nand the  'B*3'  in the formula should be changed accordingly.\r\nFurthermore, the second line should be 'editorially reworked' for\r\nproper indentation (as the text above and below) and capitalization.\r\n\r\nHence, the RFC should say:\r\n                                                           vvv\r\n|     B3[i]'(t) = B3[i](t-1) || B3[i]'(t-1) || B3[i](t) || B3*[i](t-1)\r\n\r\n|   where:\r\n\r\n         B3[i]   = the existing B3[i] value in the incoming signal\r\n         B3[i]'  = the new (compensated) B3[i] value\r\n         B3*[i]  = the B3[i] value of the unequipped VTs in the\r\n                   incoming signal\r\n         ||  =  exclusive OR operator\r\n         t   =  the time of the current frame\r\n         t-1 =  the time of the previous frame\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  Section 11.2.2.1 -- missing article\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph of Section 11.2.2.1, at the bottom of page 25,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n   A T3 is encapsulated asynchronously into a VC-3 container as\r\n|  described in Section 10.1.2.1 of [G.707].

CEP\r\n   does not introduce additional requirements from IANA.\r\n\r\nThis section should have been instructed to link one of the above\r\nmentioned PW types to RFC 4842, and perform the intended disposition\r\nwith the other one.\r\n\r\nWhatever the plans currently are, the IANA registry should be\r\nupdated accordingly and as soon as possible, to reduce the confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(12)  Appendix A -- incomplete information\r\n\r\nOn mid-page 36, just below Table 4, Appendix A says:\r\n\r\n   [...]\r\n   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate\r\n|  signal with only one SPE.  The optical super-rate signal is denoted\r\n   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N.\r\n\r\nFor completeness and clarity, the super-rate signal mentioned should\r\nbe named.  According to the layman's guess (please correct if I am\r\nwrong!), the RFC should say:\r\n\r\n   [...]\r\n   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate\r\n|  signal denoted STS-Nc, with only one SPE.  The optical super-rate\r\n   signal is denoted as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than\r\n   OC-N.",
