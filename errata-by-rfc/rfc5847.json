    "notes": "Rationale:\r\n  The RFC text varies between singular and plural form of the name\r\n  of the local variable.  A single name is necessary for consistency.\r\n  Paraphrasing from MIB doctor guidelines, counter variables should \r\n  always be in plural form.  Additionally, the related configurable\r\n  parameter is called \"MISSING_HEARTBEATS_ALLOWED \" in the RFC.\r\n  Therefore, \"MISSING_HEARTBEATS\" is chosen above as the appropriate\r\n  form and the instances of \"MISSING_HEARTBEAT\" are changed to the\r\n  plural form.",
