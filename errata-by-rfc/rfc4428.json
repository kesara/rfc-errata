In such cases, failure\r\n   detection may be assisted by an out-of-band communication channel,\r\n   and failure condition may be reported to the PXC control plane.  This\r\n   can be provided by using [RFC4209] extensions that deliver IP\r\n   message-based communication between the PXC and the OLS control\r\n   plane.
