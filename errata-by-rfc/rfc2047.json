(This is to allow the use of\r\n   multiple 'encoded-word's to represent long strings of unencoded text,\r\n   without having to separate 'encoded-word's where spaces occur in the\r\n   unencoded text.)\r\n>>\r\n\r\nSo the RFC is correct as it stands.  The text in section 2 is specifically talking about multiple encoded-words on multiple lines.  Section 6.2 covers the other case.",
