    "notes": "While this is typo, it has the unfortunate side effect of creating a possibility for a replay attack where the attacker injects a previous message, possibly causing the receiver to loose synch on the ROC value. This is prevented if the receiver uses ROC_sender in place of ROC_local during both authentication _and_ replay check.\r\n\r\nWe thank David McGrew for spotting this error.",
