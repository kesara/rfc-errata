MIB for IPv6\" are misleading.\r\nIn fact, the new RFCs extend the RADIUS MIB modules to cover\r\nIPv6, but they are not IPv6 specific!\r\nPerhaps, better wording would have been \"... for IPv4 and IPv6\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a very 'popular' clash of terms shines up here.\r\nAs specified in RFC 3410 and Part 1 of STD 62, RFC 3411, and\r\nre-stated in the boilerplate Section 3, \"The Internet-Standard\r\nManagement Framework\", of all four RFCs, there's just one single\r\nManagement Information Base (MIB) comprised of various \"MIB modules\".\r\nThus, throughout the titles and the text bodies of the RFCs, the\r\nproper term, \"RADIUS ... MIB module\" should be used instead of the\r\nrather sluggish \"RADIUS ... MIB\".",
