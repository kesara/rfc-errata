    "notes": "The section 4.2.2 specifies header size constraints and notes that implementations can send a SETTINGS frame with a SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE identifier to set a limit on the maximum size of the message header. Since this a maximum size, the sentence that states that intermediaries aren't guaranteed to accept a message below this limit seems odd and I think it should instead say \"above this limit\".",
