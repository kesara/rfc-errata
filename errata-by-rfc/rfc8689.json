    "notes": "The second sentence tries to explain/summarize the policies found in the RFCs referenced in the first sentence, about PKIX and DANE. But the explanation seems to accidentally sets new requirements that contradict behaviour specified by DANE: With DANE-EE TLSA records, no specific hostname validation must be done, instead verification is done based on (hash of) SPKI/entire certificate. (DANE-TA hostname verification is also a bit more nuanced). Since the requirements are accurately explained in the RFCs referenced in the first sentence, it seems better to completely remove the second sentence.\r\n\r\nI would also like to point out that implementers may want to take care not to treat the situation where all TLSA records are \"unusable\" (as explained in DANE RFCs) as \"authenticated with DANE\", in line with \"[...] or it MUST be verified successfully using DANE [...]\" on line 197.",
