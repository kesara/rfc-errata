    "notes": "The first and latter statements are contradictory, as a default is unlikely to apply when \"virtually all\" implementations process differently.\r\nThis correction to include \"in particular UNIX implementations\" would be appropriate at many points throughout the document in order to differentiate references to implementation specific features and terminology from references to terminology established in prior RFCs.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nReading the text in a flow isn't giving the contradiction that there is a contradiction.
