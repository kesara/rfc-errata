Since it is already contained in the effective\r\n'scsiNotifications' OID (as specified on page 23), the additional\r\nintroduction of 'scsiNotificationsPrefix' seems to be very\r\nredundant.  Its use could be easily substituted by the use of\r\n'scsiNotifications' in the two NOTIFICATION-TYPE invocations\r\non page 66, which would have resulted in the OID assignments,\r\n\r\n   scsiTgtDeviceStatusChanged NOTIFICATION-TYPE\r\n      [...]\r\n   ::= { scsiNotifications 1 }\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n   scsiLuStatusChanged NOTIFICATION-TYPE\r\n      [...]\r\n   ::= { scsiNotifications 2 }\r\n\r\nas usual in IETF MIBs.\r\n\r\nThat is now too late to be corrected, but the misleading ASN.1 comment\r\non page 66 of the RFC, as noted above, should be corrected to say:\r\n\r\n   --********************** Notifications ******************************\r\n|  -- scsiNotifications OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { scsiMIB  0 }\r\n                                                        ^^^\r\n\r\n(19)  typo\r\n\r\nThe ASN.1 comment on page 67,\r\n\r\n      -- Conditionally mandatory groups to be included with\r\n      -- the mandatory groups when the implementation has\r\n|     -- SCSI target device.\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n      -- Conditionally mandatory groups to be included with\r\n      -- the mandatory groups when the implementation has\r\n|     -- SCSI target devices.\r\n                           ^\r\n\r\n(20)  typo\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the scsiInitiatorDeviceGroup OBJECT-GROUP\r\ninvocation, on page 71, says:\r\n\r\n        \"This group is relevant for s SCSI initiator device and port.\"\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n                                    v\r\n|       \"This group is relevant for a SCSI initiator device and port.\"\r\n\r\nor even better:\r\n\r\n|       \"This group is relevant for SCSI initiator devices and ports.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(21)  duplicate / redundant text\r\n\r\nSection 10, on page 76, contains the 5th paragraph:\r\n\r\n   We assume an HBA as the SCSI initiator device and a disk as the SCSI\r\n   target device.
