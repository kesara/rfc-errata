Finally, the architecture should provide ample\r\n   opportunities to present informational URIs that relate to calls,\r\n   conversations, or dialogs in some way.  For example, consider the SIP\r\n   Call-Info header or Contact header fields returned in a 300-class\r\n   response.  Frequently, additional information about a call or dialog\r\n   can be fetched via non-SIP URIs.  For example, consider a web page\r\n   for package tracking when calling a delivery company or a web page\r\n   with related documentation when joining a dial-in conference.  The\r\n   use of URIs in the multi-party framework is discussed in more detail\r\n   in Section 3.7.",
