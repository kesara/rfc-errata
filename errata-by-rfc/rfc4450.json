    "orig_text": "(1)\r\n\r\nNear the top of page 3, section 3 of RFC 4450 states the\r\nreasons for removal from the list -- i.e. *not* moving\r\nto HISTORIC state:\r\n  o  RFC 1584  -- an expected future dependency;\r\n  o  RFC 1755  -- believed to be actively in use.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these two RFCs have been moved to HISTORIC\r\nstatus along with the publication of RFC 4450, as can be\r\nseen in rfcxx00.txt .\r\nThis is quite surprising. (Perhaps, you know what happened.)\r\n\r\nPreferrably, the final RFC text would better have been\r\ncoordinated with the actual Standards Actions performed --\r\nfor example, by addition of an IESG statement explaining the\r\ndeviation from the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nDue to the 'numeric limitation' applied (restriction to RFCs\r\nwith numbers in the range ~700...2000) there are now a couple\r\nof RFCs that have lost their 'normative background'.\r\n\r\nFor example, the higher level SNA MIBs (RFCs 2051, (2155->)2455,\r\n2456, 2457, and 2582) more or less depend on the now deprecated\r\nbasic SNA node MIBs, RFCs (1665->)1666 and 1747.  [ \"xx->yy\"\r\nis my shorthand notation for \"RFC xx obsoleted by RFC yy\". ]\r\nArguably, in this case, these dependant RFCs might be considered\r\ncandidates for a move to HISTORIC as well.\r\nBut there certainly are other cases as well (I have not yet\r\nchecked all the details).\r\n\r\nIt therefore should perhaps be considered to repeat the\r\nRFC 4450 'experiment' with an extended numeric range of RFCs,\r\ne.g. up to RFC 2500.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the restriction to Standards Track documents\r\nhas other undesired implications:\r\n\r\na) In the past, usually at least an Experimental RFC has been\r\npublished as a first try for a new protocol (or an Informational\r\nRFC, in the case of a third-party protocol), before a Standards\r\nTrack version has been developed.  Unfortunately, in this process\r\nit obviously has been avoided very often to formally OBSOLETE\r\nthe predecessor RFC[s] when the Standards Track version has been\r\npublished.  (Similar undue 'politeness' can be observed, e.g.,\r\non the transition path of MIBs from SMIv1 to SMIv2.)\r\nCaused by RFC 4450 we now have non-deprecated RFCs predating\r\nRFCs moved to HISTORIC state.\r\n(The example instances I've been aware of at first glance, though\r\nstill being listed as EXPERIMENTAL in the RFC index, fortunately\r\nalready had been removed in the past from the 'Experimental RFCs'\r\nSection of rfcxx00.txt .)\r\nIt would be very useful, for clarity, to move these RFCs to\r\nHISTORIC status as well.\r\n\r\nb) There are 'companion documents' to Standards Track RFCs that\r\nhave been published as Informational RFCs for various (legitimate)\r\nreasons.  These RFCs are outdated with their respective related\r\nspecifications, and as such, for clarity, should better be moved\r\nto HISTORIC status as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, IMHO the following Informational and Experimental RFCs,\r\nbeing closely related to RFCs that now have been deprecated, should\r\nbe considered candidates for deprecation (being made HISTORIC) as\r\nwell, for clarity, consistency, and/or historical context:\r\n\r\no  RFC 1477 (IDPR Introduction);\r\no  RFC 1482 (NSFNET Policy-Based Routing Database) -- IDPR related;\r\no  RFC 1585 (MOSPF Analysis and Experience) -- depending on RFC 1584;\r\no  RFC 1593 (SNA APPN Node MIB) -- 1st ed., eff.->2155->4255;\r\no  RFC 1634 (IPX over WAN Media) -- successor to RFC 1551, the siblings\r\n            of which (RFCs 1552 and 1553) have been made HISTORIC;\r\no  RFC 1791 (TCP+UDP over IPX);     \\  both still in\r\no  RFC 1792 (TCP/IPX MIB);          /  rfcxx00.txt !\r\no  RFC 1834 (WHOIS++ Introduction);\r\no  RFC 1875 (UNINETT PCA Policy) -- based on PEM.\r\n\r\nIt might therefore perhaps be useful to perform a RFC 4450 like\r\n'experiment' for Informational and Experimental RFCs as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)\r\n\r\nThe restriction in the RFC 4450 effort on Proposed Standards\r\ndetracts from the fact that there are [Full] Standard RFCs as\r\nwell which are clearly outdated, or of questionable quality and/or\r\nprecision.\r\nMy personal (incomplete) hot list of candidates comprises:\r\n     STDs 15, 16, 17, 19, 35, 40, 42, 44, 49\r\n(Other legacy Standards doubtlessly should be updated, e.g.\r\nSTDs 5, 7, 13.)\r\n\r\nNote: In particular the situation with STDs 16+17 is annoying.\r\n      Replacements are established, but vendors do not switch\r\n      to SMIv2 and the newer MIBs (and do not offer SNMPv3,\r\n      with its improved security features!) because these old\r\n      specifications are still listed as Standard.\r\n\r\nI also strongly suspect that there are a few Draft Standard RFCs\r\nthat might be considered outdated.\r\n\r\nIt therefore might be worth repeating the RFC 4450 'experiment'\r\nfor Draft and Full Standards as well.",
