If a new IPsec SA is created, then\r\n|\r\n       a new SPI is allocated for the security association.

[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.6 -- a typo and a word omission\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph on page 37 says:\r\n\r\n                              v\r\n|  If an RSVP message can taket more than one possible path, then the\r\n   IPsec engine will experience difficulties protecting the message.\r\n   Even if the RSVP daemon installs a traffic selector with the\r\n   destination IP address, still, no distinguishing element allows\r\n   selection of the correct security association for one of the possible\r\n|  RSVP nodes along the path.  Even if it possible to apply IPsec\r\n   protection (in tunnel mode) for RSVP signaling messages by\r\n   incorporating some additional information, there is still the\r\n   possibility that the tunneled messages do not recognize a path change\r\n   in a non-RSVP router.

[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.7 -- spurious blank line\r\n\r\nSimilar as noted in item (6) above, there is a spurious blank line\r\nin the first paragraph of Section 5.7.\r\nOn top of page 38, the RFC says:\r\n\r\n   mechanism, but authentication might, in many cases, be insufficient\r\n   for authorization.  The communication procedures defined for policy\r\n|\r\n   objects [42] can be improved to support the more efficient per-\r\n   channel financial settlement model by avoiding policy handling\r\n   between inter-domain networks at a signaling message granularity.\r\n   [...]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   mechanism, but authentication might, in many cases, be insufficient\r\n   for authorization.
