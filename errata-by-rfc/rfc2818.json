    "notes": "The submitted errata indicated that multiple wildcards were allowed (e.g., *.*.a.com matches foo.bar.a.com but not foo.com).  This is too large of a change to make with an errata.  The Security and Application ADs feel a consensus call would be required to make that change.  Further, the current practice is to allow only one at the leftmost position.  This is being documented in draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check-09 and its intended to be a BCP.\r\n\r\nThe errata does however correct a misplaced parentheses, and uses semi-colons to separate examples.",
