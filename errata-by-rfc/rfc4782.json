This receive window\r\n   should allow the other TCP host to fully use the approved Quick-Start\r\n   Request.\r\n\r\n   If the TCP host doesn't know the round-trip time, the TCP host\r\n   could use an estimate of the round-trip time in calculating the\r\n   required buffer space.  Alternately, the TCP host could base the\r\n   advertised receive window on the available buffer space, without\r\n   calculating the buffer space required for the other TCP host to\r\n   fully use the approved Quick-Start Request.\r\n\r\n   If the Quick-Start Response is sent in a SYN/ACK packet, then\r\n   window scaling of the receive window is not allowed [RFC1323];\r\n   if necessary, the TCP host could send a scaled receive window\r\n   in a separate ACK packet following the SYN/ACK packet.",
