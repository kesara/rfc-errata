    "notes": "The 'Match for data reception' is an behavior on the MVPN receiver-site PE. If an SPMSI A-D route is matched for data reception, it means that the receiver-site PE will respond to this SPMSI A-D route, either send a responded Leaf A-D route in case there is an explicit-tracking flag (LIR or LIRpF), or join the PMSI tunnel in the SPMSI A-D route in case the tunnel type is mLDP/PIM etc. This usage of 'match for data reception' is not explicitly explained in this RFC but it is used in <draft-ietf-bess-mvpn-expl-track-13>. \r\nThere is clear inclusive-selective relationship between S-PMSI A-D (*,*) and S-PMSI A-D(S,G).\r\nThinking the S-PMSI A-D (*,*) as an Inclusive one, the receiver site PE with a (C-S,C-G) state should keep its join state on both the S-PMSI A-D (*,*) and S-PMSI A-D(S,G), and setup the 'reception state' on both the (*,*) PMSI-tunnel and (S,G) PMSI-tunnel. So the 'match for reception' should be one or more SPMSI A-D routes.  The 'if/othersize/othersize' sentences make the wrong meaning.",
