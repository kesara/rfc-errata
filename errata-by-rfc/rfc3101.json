If both of them are Type-7 LSAs, one of them would be flushed according 2.4: \r\n   If two NSSA routers, both\r\n   reachable from one another over the NSSA, originate functionally\r\n   equivalent Type-7 LSAs (i.e., same destination, cost and non-zero\r\n   forwarding address), then the router having the least preferred LSA\r\n   should flush its LSA.\r\n\r\nAs a result, rule (e) would never be applied and should be removed.\r\n\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nIt is easy to envision a topology where an ABR for an NSSA receives an NSSA-LSA from an NSSA internal router and an AS-Exernal-LSA from originating routers that do not receive each others equivalent LSAs. Furthermore, even if this were not the case, the  referenced text refers to LSAs that are both NSSA-LSAs as opposed to a\r\nmixture of an NSSA-LSA and an AS-External-LSA.\r\n",
