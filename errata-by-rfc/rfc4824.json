This\r\ndiscrepancy between the current specification and the references may\r\nalso result in both implementation and execution differences, as some\r\ninterfaces may already have signal 'Y' hard-coded according to [JCroft]\r\nor [Wikipedia], which will result in transmission of an SFS which will\r\nnot be understood by an interface that follows the current specification\r\nstrictly.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Errors in the forms of SFS representation for SFS V/KAL and SFS Y/RTT.\r\n\r\nfrom pending",

    "orig_text": "RFC 4824 completely fails to appropriatey point out the benefits and\r\nmerits of IP-SFS, and to perform a fair comparison with industry\r\nstandard strenght security for common wireless protocols.\r\n\r\nApparently, IP-SFS provides for industry standard Wireless Equivalent\r\nPrivacy (WEP).  It *is* a wireless protocol!  Its interfaces do not\r\nconsume electrical power (if used under daylight conditions) and do not\r\nproduce any electromagnetical interference.  The former property\r\nresults in great applicability to developing economies that lack\r\nsubstantial ubiquitous electrical power distribution but have a lot of\r\ncheap manpower available, but it also makes IP-SFS great for countries\r\nwith instable electrical power distribution systems, like the U.S.\r\n(and, yet currently still to a lesser degree, Europe).  Both properties\r\ntogether make IP-SFS strictly immune to any modern cryptanalytical\r\nmethods based on the variation of power consumption over time and to\r\nthe suspected industry espionage by the electronical 'sky ears' still\r\ndeployed in Europe and otherwise mostly idle, since the end of the Cold\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, IP-SFS apparently is very well suited for environments\r\nwith stringent legal requirements for the war against the Axis of\r\nEvil, with its step-by-step increasing legal custody of privacy and\r\npolitical correctness of content to be performed / enforced by\r\nlegal authorities and cooperating access and content providers.\r\n\r\nThat should make IP-SFS particularly interesting for the emerging\r\ninfrastructure of the .cn domain (and for many other countries,\r\nas well).\r\n\r\nTo change the disadvantageous presentation of IP-SFS and to address\r\nat least a few of its benefits, I recommend to change, via an RFC\r\nErrata Note, the first paragraph of Section 5,\r\n\r\n|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered\r\n|  insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly\r\n|  discouraged unless security is provided by higher level protocols.\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered to\r\n|  provide industry strength wireless equivalent security and privacy\r\n|  (WEP).  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly\r\n|  discouraged unless security is provided by legal environments or\r\n|  corporate guidelines of conduct, impending punishment of the\r\n|  interfaces, or other higher level protocols.\r\n\r\n\r\n:-)",
