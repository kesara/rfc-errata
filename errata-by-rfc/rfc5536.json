Let me give a simpler example:\r\n\r\n    foo = *(\"a\" / \"b\") / *(\"c\" / \"d\")\r\n\r\nThis means the following are valid: ab aabb bab cd ccdd dcd\r\nBut the following are not: abcd ac\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that the latter is intended to be valid, for which the syntax would be:\r\n\r\n    foo = *(\"a\" / \"b\" / \"c\" / \"d\")\r\n\r\nIt isn't easy to do a valid syntax extension that achieves this effect \r\nbecause of way the ABNF of RFC5322 is structured. However, after offline \r\ndiscussion, we realized that RFC5322 already has an extension point for \r\nnew headers via the <optional-field> rule. Along with that, RFC3864 \r\nestablished a process for registering header fields with IANA.\r\n\r\nThe above fix is based on discussion with Pete Resnick (editor of RFC 5322), Julien Ã‰LIE, Alexey Melnikov and Paul Kyzivat.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix from Paul Kyzuvat is:\r\n\r\nSo, my recommendation is that to fix this, remove from section 3 the \r\nextension of the <fields> rule:\r\n\r\n    fields          =/ *( approved / ...\r\n                          xref )\r\n\r\nInstead, simply rely on the text to specify the newly defined header \r\nfields, and the IANA registration to link them to RFC5322.\r\n",
