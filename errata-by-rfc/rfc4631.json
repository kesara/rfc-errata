    "notes": "Some of the errata listed above correspond to errata also reported for RFC 4327 (referred to as \"old\").\r\n\r\nfrom pending\r\n\r\n--VERIFIER COMMENT--\r\nWhile many of these comments would undoubtedly have led to a more polished \r\nfinal RFC it is fortunate that none of them makes the document in any way \r\nharder to read or less technically meaningful. I am sure that if and when \r\nthe RFC progresses from Proposed Standard to Draft Standard we can look back \r\nat this list to ensure that your comments are addressed.\r\n\r\nIn future, however, I would urge you to make comments on the content and \r\nformat of CCAMP documents as they progress through the working group or \r\nduring IETF last call. Comments made later than that are very unlikely to be \r\nconsidered by the authors for inclusion, but comments made earlier in the \r\nprocess are very likely to be included.\r\n\r\nObviously, if issues of technical clarity or understanding do come up later \r\nthan this, we can address them through Errata while a new revision of the \r\nRFC is prepared. On the other hand, Errata are probably not well used for \r\nrecording small format errors in the text as these are not strictly errors \r\nof content or substance.",
