    "notes": "Aside from the missing comma on the parenthetical, the use of MAY NOT, even uncapitalized, appears to collide with RFC 2119: It's pretty clear the authors intended to say that there may exist conditions in which Geopriv won't secure targets, but the chosen wording, interpreted in context of 2119, means that Geopriv *will not* or *must not* secure Targets, and that interpretation is sort of bogus.\r\n\r\nIn short: May here is directive, rather than predictive/descriptive, which seems what was intended.",
