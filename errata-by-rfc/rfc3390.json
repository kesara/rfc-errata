In experiments over a 28.8 bps dialup channel [All97a,\r\n   AHO98], a four-segment initial window decreased the transfer time of\r\n   a 16KB file by roughly 10%, with no accompanying increase in the drop\r\n   rate.  A simulation study [RFC2416] investigated the effects of using\r\n   a larger initial window on a host connected by a slow modem link and\r\n   a router with a 3 packet buffer.  The study concluded that for the\r\n   scenario investigated, the use of larger initial windows was not\r\n   harmful to TCP performance.",
