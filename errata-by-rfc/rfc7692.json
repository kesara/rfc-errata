    "notes": "It is currently possible for a client and a server to implement per spec and fail to make a connection.\r\n\r\nThere is no requirement for a client to implement this purely optional parameter, nor to understand this parameter if not implemented. If not supported, this would result in an invalid configuration. As a result, point 7 mandates that the socket connection MUST be closed.\r\nThis will only occur if a client has no implementation for this parameter and does not understand/accept the parameter, and the server sends an unsolicited \"server_no_context_takeover\" parameter in its response, which is allowed.",
