If the Modem is not including IPv4 and IPv6 Connection Point Data Items in the Peer Offer Signal, then the IP source field in the packet MUST be set to the unicast address the router must use when connecting the DLEP TCP session, otherwise any valid local address MUST be used.  The IP destination field in the packet MUST be set to the IP source field value received in the Peer Discovery Signal.  The Peer Offer Signal completes the discovery process; see Section 7.1.",

There has been discussion in the WG about the proper wording for the \"corrected text\", but no definitive conclusion has been reached.
