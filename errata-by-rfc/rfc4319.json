Therefore, text replications from one object\r\nto another object without proper adaptation are sub-optimal, at best.\r\nIn particular, referencing an object within its DESCRIPTION clause\r\nby name, while omitting to call another object (referenced there)\r\nby its name does not add much to the clarity of the DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose to slightly modify the DESCRIPTION clause of\r\nthe hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMaxLineRate OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on top\r\nof page 46.  This clause is affected by issue (7) as well.\r\n\r\nThe clause says:\r\n\r\n        \"This object configures the maximum transmission rate for\r\n         the associated SHDSL Line in bits-per-second (bps) and includes\r\n         both payload (user data) and any applicable framing overhead.\r\n         If the minimum line rate equals the maximum line rate\r\n         (hdsl2ShdslSpanMaxLineRate), the line rate is considered\r\n         'fixed'.

This emphasizes the similarities\r\nbetween these objects but leaves the reader alone as to the use and\r\ndiffering purpose of the objects.  It would be very desirable to\r\nhave additional expanatory text added to these four descriptions\r\nto clarify the intended use (e.g., as an alarm limit).\r\n\r\n    ",
