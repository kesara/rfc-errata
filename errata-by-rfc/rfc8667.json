    "notes": "Since the SID/Index/Label field is defined in this subsection, it's misleading for the title to mention only the flags and is a disservice to readers using the document as a reference.\r\n\r\nThis is also discussed in https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/lsr/56_LEEZvHDHrnkC98f7BtpOkkY0/ where Acee also suggests a broader clarification. The narrowly-scoped change reflected in this erratum seems sufficient to fix the problem I encountered; in my view, it doesn't preclude an additional erratum for some of the other matters that were mentioned by Acee if there's support for that as well.\r\n\r\nThanks to Tony Li for suggesting the wording.\r\n\r\n<Andrew Note> I agree this helps clarify the text which could easily have otherwise been misread - hence the verification of the errata",
