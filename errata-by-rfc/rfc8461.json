On page 8, one of the example says \"<CRLF>\" explicitly at the end of the first line, while the second line of that example and all lines of the other example have neither \"<CRLF>\" nor \"<LF>\" appended to them.   That makes it ambiguous whether those lines are terminated by LF or by CRLF.",

Either the instruction needs to be changed, a new delimiter needs to be defined that doesn't permit whitespace before the semicolon, or sts-field-delim needs to be modified.",
