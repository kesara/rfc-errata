    "orig_text": "(1)  Section 1 -- mis-expansion of acronym\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of page 2, Section 1 of RFC 4968 says:\r\n\r\n                   [...].  Another method is to treat the IEEE 802.16\r\n|  MAC (Message Authentication Code) transport connections between an MS\r\n   (Mobile Station) and BS (Base Station) as point-to-point IP links so\r\n   that the IP protocols (e.g., ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), IPv6\r\n   Neighbor Discovery) can be run without any problems.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                   [...].  Another method is to treat the IEEE 802.16\r\n|  MAC (Media Access Control) transport connections between an MS\r\n   (Mobile Station) and BS (Base Station) as point-to-point IP links so\r\n   that the IP protocols (e.g., ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), IPv6\r\n   Neighbor Discovery) can be run without any problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 3.1 -- typo/grammar\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 3.1 says, at the bottom of page 3:\r\n             v\r\n                                  [...].  The following figures\r\n|  illustrates a high-level view of this link model wherein [...]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                                  [...].  The following figures\r\n|  illustrate a high-level view of this link model wherein [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  missing articles\r\n\r\n(3a)\r\nThe RFC text regularly uses \"to an AR\", \"via the AR\", etc.\r\nIt also should not omit the article 'the' in \"of the AR\"\r\nand in other context.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n- Section 3.1, 1st paragraph (page 5), 7th line:\r\n    \"support of AR\"           -->   \"support of the AR\"\r\n\r\n- Section 3.1.4.2 (page 6), 2nd line:\r\n    \"backend process in AR\"   -->   \"backend process in the AR\"\r\n\r\n- Section 3.1.4.4 (page 6), 3rd line:\r\n    \"the MS and AR\"           -->   \"the MS and the AR\"\r\n\r\n(3b)\r\nSimilar inconsistent use/non-use of the article occurs for \"BS\".\r\nFor instance,\r\n\r\n- Section 3.3.4.6 (page 11), 2nd line:\r\n    \"implemented in BS\"       -->   \"implemented in the BS\"\r\n\r\n- Section 4, first paragraph on page 12, last line:\r\n    \"sends a single RA to BS\" -->   \"sends a single RA to the BS\"\r\n\r\n- Section 4, last paragraph (page 12), 2nd line:\r\n    \"sent by the AR to BS\"    -->   \"sent by the AR to the BS\"\r\n\r\n(3c)\r\nFinally, I found inconsistent use of the article for \"Ethernet CS\"\r\nin the first paragraph of Section 7, on page 13.  The RFC says:\r\n\r\n   Ethernet-Like Link models would be used when the deployment requires\r\n|  the use of Ethernet CS, as this is the only model being proposed for\r\n   the Ethernet CS and running IPv6 over Ethernet is well understood.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   Ethernet-Like Link models would be used when the deployment requires\r\n|  the use of the Ethernet CS, as this is the only model being proposed\r\n   for the Ethernet CS and running IPv6 over Ethernet is well\r\n   understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  grammar / word omission\r\n\r\nOn page 9, Section 3.2.3.6 contains the bullet:\r\n\r\n|  1.  Each MS is assigned a separate VLAN when IEEE 802.1X [12] or each\r\n       MS must have an L2 tunnel to the AR to aggregate all the\r\n|      connections to the MS and present these set of connections as an\r\n       interface to the IPv6 layer.\r\n\r\nThis sentence does not parse.  Perhaps, it should say:\r\n\r\n|  1.  Each MS is assigned a separate VLAN when IEEE 802.1X [12] is used\r\n       or each MS must have an L2 tunnel to the AR to aggregate all the\r\n|      connections to the MS and present this set of connections as an\r\n       interface to the IPv6 layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  extraneous word\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of Section 3.3.4.2 (on page 11) says:\r\n\r\n   Nevertheless, in case of bridging, direct inter-MSs communication may\r\n|  not be not allowed due to restrictions from the service providers.\r\n   ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   Nevertheless, in case of bridging, direct inter-MSs communication may\r\n|  not be allowed due to restrictions from the service providers.\r\n   ^^^^^^\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  References\r\n\r\nIn Section 11.2, in the entries [4] and [5], a space character should\r\nhave been inserted after \"Part 16:\" .\r\nDo these two documents really have the same title ?\r\n",
