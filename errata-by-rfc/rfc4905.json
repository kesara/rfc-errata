The\r\n   PWE3 Label Distribution Protocol control protocol document [RFC4447],\r\n   which is backward compatible with this document, MUST be used for all\r\n   new implementations of this protocol.\r\n\r\nRoughly, RFC 4447 is the Standards Track successor of RFC 4906;\r\nthus, both sentences are perfectly proper in the context of RFC 4906,\r\nbut they should have been replaced by more specific text matching\r\nthe technical contents of RFC 4905 and listing the corresponding\r\nStandards Track documents.\r\n",
