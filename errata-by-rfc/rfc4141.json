    "orig_text": "(1)\r\n\r\nIn Section 1.2, the last paragraph at the bottom of page 4 says:\r\n\r\n     *  three MIME Content header fields (Content-Convert, Content-\r\n        Previous and *  Content-Features) that specify appropriate\r\n        content header fields and record conversions that have been\r\n        performed.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n     *  three MIME Content header fields (Content-Convert, Content-\r\n|       Previous and Content-Features) that specify appropriate\r\n        content header fields and record conversions that have been\r\n        performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nIn Section 3, the fourth paragraph on page 6 says:\r\n\r\n   When CONPERM is used, conversions are performed by the first ESMTP\r\n   host that can obtain both the originator's permission and information\r\n   about the capabilities supported by the recipient.  If a relay or\r\n   client is unable to transmit the message to a next-hop that supports\r\n   CONPERM or to perform appropriate conversion, then it terminates\r\n   message transmission and returns a [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT, SYSCOD] to the\r\n   originator, with status code 5.6.3 (Conversion required but not\r\n   supported).\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   When CONPERM is used, conversions are performed by the first ESMTP\r\n   host that can obtain both the originator's permission and information\r\n   about the capabilities supported by the recipient.  If a relay or\r\n   client is unable to transmit the message to a next-hop that supports\r\n   CONPERM or to perform appropriate conversion, then it terminates\r\n|  message transmission and returns a Delivery Status Notification (DSN)\r\n   [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT, SYSCOD] to the originator, with status code 5.6.3\r\n   (Conversion required but not supported).\r\n\r\nRationale:  Probably, that triple of RFCs should not be sent  :-)\r\nThe proposed text change conforms to the current authoring style\r\nguides for I-Ds / RFCs, spelling out the abbreviation 'MDN' at its\r\nfirst occurrance in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the final NOTE in Section 3, on page 9, says:\r\n\r\n         NOTE: An originator MAY validate any conversions that are made\r\n         by requesting a positive [DSNSMTP].  ...\r\n\r\nwhere it should better say:\r\n\r\n         NOTE: An originator MAY validate any conversions that are made\r\n|        by requesting a positive DSN [DSNSMTP].  ...\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)\r\n\r\nThe second item of the first enumerated list in Section 3.3,\r\non page 12, contains a (visually hidden) word replication.\r\nThe text says:\r\n\r\n      2) MUST return a DSN notification to the originator, with status\r\n         code 5.6.3 (Conversion required but not supported).  [DSNSMTP,\r\n         DSNFMT, SYSCOD]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n|     2) MUST return a DSN to the originator, with status code 5.6.3\r\n         (Conversion required but not supported).  [DSNSMTP, DSNFMT,\r\n         SYSCOD]\r\n\r\nRationale: The trailing \"N\" of \"DSN\" already stands for \"notification\".\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)\r\n\r\nTo make the spelling of [E]SMTP keywords and verbs consistent within\r\nthe text, the headline of Section 4.2 (on page 13),\r\n\r\n  4.2.  CONPERM Parameter to Mail-From\r\n\r\nshould better use uppercaes spelling as well, to read:\r\n\r\n  4.2.  CONPERM Parameter to MAIL-FROM\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)\r\n\r\nThe ABNF given in Section 7, on page 16, and Section 8, on page 17,\r\ndoes not fully conform to the contemporary (RFC 2822) style.\r\nThe ABNF in Section 7 omits the explicit specification of white\r\nspace usage that presumably has been intended.\r\nThe ABNF in Section 8 inserts a paramount of CFWS.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n- RFC 2822 has deprecated the use of white space between header\r\n  field names and the subsequent \":\" and, as far as I can see,\r\n  comments have not been allowed at such places by RFC 822,\r\n  and aren't by the \"obsolete syntax\" in RFC 2822.\r\n- RFC 2822 has carefully made [C]FWS an intrinsic part of many\r\n  low-level syntactic constructs to improve readability of the\r\n  high-level ABNF productions. Thus, CFWS should not be inserted\r\n  again where it is (logically) already present.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the spelling of ABNF production names should be\r\nself-consistent within a certain field. RFC 2822 makes use of\r\nlowercase production (rule) names for teh syntactic description\r\nof the Internet Message Format; therefore it seems preferrable\r\nto follow this style when defining IMF extensions.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these explanations (and detailed inspection of\r\nRFC 2822), the ABNF productions in Section 7 :\r\n\r\n      Convert =                \"Content-convert\" \":\"\r\n                               permitted\r\n\r\n      Permitted =              \"ANY\" / \"NONE\" / permitted-list\r\n\r\nshould perhaps be re-written as :\r\n\r\n      convert =           \"Content-convert:\" [CFWS] permitted\r\n\r\n      permitted =         \"ANY\" / \"NONE\" / permitted-list\r\n\r\nand the ABNF productions in Section 8 :\r\n\r\n      previous =          \"Content-Previous\" [CFWS] \":\"\r\n                          [CFWS]\r\n                          date by type\r\n\r\n      date =              \"Date \" [CFWS] date-time [CFWS] \";\"\r\n                          [CFWS]\r\n\r\n      by =                \"By \" [CFWS] domain [CFWS] \";\"\r\n                          [CFWS]\r\n\r\nshould perhaps be re-written as :\r\n\r\n      previous =          \"Content-Previous:\" date by type\r\n\r\n      date =              \"Date \" [CFWS] date-time \";\" [CFWS]\r\n\r\n      by =                \"By \" domain \";\" [CFWS]\r\n\r\nor even (disallowing comments after \"Date \" - like RFC 2822 does):\r\n\r\n      previous =          \"Content-Previous:\" date by type\r\n\r\n      date =              \"Date \" date-time \";\" [CFWS]\r\n\r\n      by =                \"By \" domain \";\" [CFWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)\r\n\r\nThe examples in Section 9 contain improperly truncated references\r\nto MIME Content-Types.\r\nThe following line that appears\r\n  -  in Section 9.1 in the 3rd text line on page 18,\r\nand\r\n  -  in Section 9.2 in the 10th text line :\r\n\r\n   C: <<RFC 2822 message with MIME Content-Type:TIFF-FX\r\n\r\nshould, in both cases, read:\r\n\r\n   C: <<RFC 2822 message with MIME Content-Type: image/TIFF-FX\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)\r\n\r\nIn Appendix C, the headline:\r\n\r\n  Appendix C.  MIME Content-Type Registrations\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n  Appendix C.  MIME Header Field Registrations\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in Appendix C, the IANA should have been directed to\r\nadd to the MIME Header Registration for \"Content-Features:\"\r\nan additional reference to RFC 4141.\r\nE.g., add on page 25, before the \"Authors' Addresses\":\r\n\r\n  C.3.  Content-Features\r\n\r\n    This memo substantially amends the specification of the\r\n    MIME Header Field \"Content-Features:\" registered by [[FEAT].\r\n    The IANA should include into the 'Specification document(s)'\r\n    clause of that registration a pointer to RFC 4141.\r\n\r\n",

    "notes": "From Dave Crocker:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on such an excellent job of proof-reading. I certainly do\r\nrecommend that you post your note on the errata page.\r\n\r\nAll of your points are worth considering.  Some entail simple errors and\r\nsome entail matters of taste.\r\n\r\nI believe that the errors you cite do not change the substance of the\r\nspecification, although the question of white space syntax could formally   \r\ninvolve a meaningful technical error.  (Normally it would be clear that it\r\nis significant; given the history of RFC733/RFC722/RFC2822 and the slow\r\nadoption of 2822, I'm not too worried that the error in our document will\r\nhurt real-world interoperability.\r\n\r\nfrom pending",
