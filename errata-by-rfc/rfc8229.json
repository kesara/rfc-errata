    "correct_text": "TCP provides reliable transport, so there is no need for applications \r\nto deal with retransmissions. Moreover, sending retransmissions by IKE \r\nin case of TCP on congested networks could further increase congestion \r\nand degrade performance. For this reason IKE initiators SHOULD NOT \r\nretransmit requests if they are sent over TCP. However, both IKE \r\ninitiators and responders MUST correctly handle retransmitted messages \r\nreceived over TCP, but responders SHOULD NOT resend response messages \r\nin this case. If IKE initiators still choose to retransmit requests \r\nover TCP, then the retransmission policy SHOULD be less aggressive than \r\nit would have been in case of UDP.\r\n",
    "notes": "While Section 12.2 discusses some implications that TCP transport could have on ESP protocol, the IKE retransmission behavior, described in Section 2.1 of RFC7296, is not redefined by this RFC. This is an oversight and some recommendations for implementers should have been given. The suggested text should be placed in a new section, presumably between sections 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nPaul Wouters:\r\n\r\nThe reported of this errata is writing a bis draft for this document where this is indeed already clarified.\r\nSee https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ipsecme-rfc8229bis-05#section-7.2\r\n\r\nResolving as Held for Document Update",
