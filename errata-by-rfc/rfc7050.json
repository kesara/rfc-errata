RFC 8880 that updates RFC 7050 specifies a resolution to this errata. ",

There was some additional discussion around this for other potential improvements that should be considered in case the specification is revised. \r\n\r\nMail thread: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/behave/KuvD2ppb9LLD3LnzS-DJ7wVCgvc/",
