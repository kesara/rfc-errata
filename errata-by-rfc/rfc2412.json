    "notes": "This is a terminology clarification.\r\n\r\nFor primes P and Q related such that P = 2Q + 1, P is a \"safe prime\" and Q is a \"Sophie Germain prime\"  The draft gets this definition backward.  The draft also suggests that \"strong\" primes are equivalent to Sophie Germain primes, which is not necessarily the case.\r\n\r\nSection 2.8 also misspells \"Germain\" with an extra e at the end twice.\r\n\r\nsee for example: http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1996-65-213/S0025-5718-96-00670-9/S0025-5718-96-00670-9.pdf",
