    "notes": "I do not have a corrected text. The above text doesn't say what RFC2473 section 7.2 says, so... what should it be? RFC2473 7.2 says to use the DF bit and decide whether to inner fragment or drop+send ICMP error. The above text seems to make normative statements that counter at least the DF=1 case in RFC2473 7.2. Also the text above says \"Fragmentation MUST happen after the encapsulation of the IPv6 packet.\". The IPv6 packet isn't encapsulated, so that sentence should be changed?\r\n\r\n--- Verifier note ---\r\nFollowing the discussion in https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/softwires/bBQT97R7p1Ho4cUZIP2MFU5ZYJ4/ , the original intent is to avoid fragmenting the IPv4 packet before encapsulation.",
