If this was the reason for\r\nomitting the named RFCs from Section 11 of RFC 4632, it would\r\nperhaps have been useful to \"obsolete\" these RFCs by RFC 4632.\r\nThis situation is bound to recur with more Informational RFCs\r\npublished as companion documents to Standards Track RFCs;\r\nthus, a general procedural solution should be sought to visibly\r\n(in the RFC index) 'outdate' such RFCs when updates get published.\r\n",
