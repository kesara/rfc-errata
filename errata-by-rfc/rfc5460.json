    "notes": "The term \"Client-Id\" in second paragraph sounds like client's Client-Id and it will be different for more than one client's data. So it should be corrected to \"requestor's Client-ID\" or \"Leasequery's Client-ID\" instead of just \"Client-ID\".\r\n\r\nMark Stapp reviewed this erratum and agrees that it is an improvement.
