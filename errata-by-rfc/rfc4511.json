    "notes": "As currently written, the specification requires IMPLICIT tagging for the not-filter. This, according to ITU-T X.690, Section 8.14.3, Example \"Type5\", requires the [2]-tag of the not-filter to overwrite the tag of the negated filter, making reliable identification of the type of the negated filter impossible. Thus, the definition of the not-filter needs to specify EXPLICIT tagging. Alternatively, the filter could be specified as \r\n\r\nnot [2] SEQUENCE { filter Filter },\r\n\r\nor (to match the definition of \"and\" and \"or\")\r\n\r\nnot [2] SET SIZE (1..1) OF filter Filter,\r\n\r\nThis applies to both, Section 4.5.1 and Appendix B.",

While the client may be able proceed with another\r\n   version of this protocol (which may or may not require closing and\r\n   re-establishing the transport connection), how to proceed with\r\n   another version of this protocol is beyond the scope of this\r\n   document.  Clients that are unable or unwilling to proceed SHOULD\r\n   terminate the LDAP session.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                                                 vvvv\r\n|            [...].
