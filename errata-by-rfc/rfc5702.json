Signature Type Downgrade Attacks\r\n\r\n   Since each RRSet MUST be signed with each algorithm present in the\r\n   DNSKEY RRSet at the zone apex (see Section 2.2 of [RFC4035]), a\r\n   malicious party cannot filter out the RSA/SHA-2 RRSIG and force the\r\n   validator to use the RSA/SHA-1 signature if both are present in the\r\n   zone.  This should provide resilience against algorithm downgrade\r\n   attacks, if the validator supports RSA/SHA-2.",

Although the requirement on signers does exist, there is no related requirement for validators to check that all signature algorithms are present. RFC6840 5.11 (which I do realise is newer than RFC5702) re-states this explicitly, where RFC4035 merely implied this distinction.\r\n",
