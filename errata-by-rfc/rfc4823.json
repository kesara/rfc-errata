    "orig_text": "(A)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is annoying to find this RFC notoriously neglecting\r\ncontemporary standard IETF terminology, using the sluggish and\r\nconfusing \"header\" where in fact \"header field\" should be used.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to RFC 2822, RFC 3864, RFC 4021, and RFC 4249\r\nfor the proper definitions of the established IETF terminology.\r\n\r\nTo quote from page 3 of RFC 4249:\r\n\r\n3.1.1.  Standard Terminology\r\n\r\n   Terms related to the Internet Message Format are defined in\r\n   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields should use\r\n   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity and\r\n   avoid confusion.  For example, a \"header\" [I1.FYI18], [N2.RFC2822] is\r\n   comprised of \"header fields\", each of which has a \"field name\" and\r\n   usually has a \"field body\".  Each message may have multiple\r\n   \"headers\", viz. a message header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.\r\n\r\n   A message header has a Date header field (i.e., a field with field\r\n   name \"Date\").  However, there is no \"Date header\"; use of such non-\r\n   standard terms is likely to lead to confusion, possibly resulting in\r\n   interoperability failures of implementations.\r\n\r\nThere's only a single place in the RFC where the correct term,\r\n\"header field\" is used!\r\n\r\nThere are much too many instances of this primary issue to mention\r\nin detail -- there are roughly 60 instances of this flaw, starting\r\nwith the title of Section 5, in the ToC, \"AS3-Specific Headers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n(B)\r\n\r\nFurther textual flaws are presented in RFC textual order.\r\nI use change bars ('|' in column 1) and occasionally\r\nup/down pointing marker lines ('^^^'/'vvv') to emphasize\r\nthe location of textual issues and/or proposed corrections.\r\nModified text has been re-adjusted to match RFC formatting\r\nrules, where appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)  Section 2.3.1  -- indentation\r\n\r\nIn Section 2.3.1, the second-to-last list item on page 5 says:\r\n\r\n                      vv\r\n|  Non-repudiation of NRR is a \"legal event\" that occurs when the\r\n   receipt (NRR)        original sender of an EDI/EC interchange has\r\n                        verified the signed receipt coming back from the\r\n                        receiver.  NRR IS NOT a functional or a\r\n                        technical message.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                      vv\r\n|  Non-repudiation of   NRR is a \"legal event\" that occurs when the\r\n   receipt (NRR)        original sender of an EDI/EC interchange has\r\n                        verified the signed receipt coming back from the\r\n                        receiver.  NRR IS NOT a functional or a\r\n                        technical message.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 3.7\r\n\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n\r\n   This Internet RFC defines how a Message Disposition Notification\r\n|  (MDN)is requested, as well as the format and syntax of the MDN.  [..]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   This Internet RFC defines how a Message Disposition Notification\r\n|  (MDN) is requested, as well as the format and syntax of the MDN.  [..]\r\n        ^\r\n\r\n(3)  Section 6.3.2\r\n\r\nBeyond issue (A), there are multiple other flaws in the text of\r\nSection 6.3.2; the RFC says (on page 16):\r\n\r\n                          [...].  The Content-Transfer-Encoding header\r\n   SHOULD NOT be used; if the header is present, it SHOULD have a value\r\n   of binary or 8-bit.  The absence of this header or the use of\r\n   alternate values such as \"base64\" or \"quoted-printable\" MUST NOT\r\n   result in transaction failure.  Content transfer encoding of MIME\r\n   parts within the AS3 message are similarly constrained.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                          [...].  The Content-Transfer-Encoding header\r\n|  field SHOULD NOT be used; if this header field is present anyway, it\r\n|  SHOULD have a value of binary or 8-bit.  The absence of this header\r\n|  field or the use of alternate field values such as \"base64\" or\r\n|  \"quoted-printable\" MUST NOT result in transaction failure.  The\r\n|  Content-Transfer-Encoding of MIME bodies within the AS3 message is\r\n|  similarly constrained.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nUsually, only the *body* of a MIME entity (a RFC 2822 message or a MIME\r\nbody part) is subject to transfer encoding -- cf. RFC 2045, Section 2;\r\nthe MIME header (yes, in this case it's the `header`!) is subject to\r\nencoding according to RFC 2047 and RFC 2231.  Thus, it is essential\r\nhere to distinguish precisely between these terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  Appendix A.2\r\n\r\nNear the bottom of page 38, there's a typo in the Note #1.\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n                     v\r\n|     1.
