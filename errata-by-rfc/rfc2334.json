After doing a review of RFC2334 for any incomplete IANA actions, IANA contacted an author to confirm if a registry for the algorithms needed to be set-up.  Joel Halpern confirmed that it the actual purpose of the section is only to make sure that there is something eveyrone can use for interoperability.  He suggested I submit an errata for the removal of the last paragraph.",
