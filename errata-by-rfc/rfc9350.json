For the FAD sub-\r\n   TLV, there are a number of sub-sub-TLVs (defined below) that are\r\n   supported.  For a given Flex-Algorithm, it is possible that the total\r\n   number of octets required to completely define a FAD exceeds the\r\n   maximum length supported by a single FAD sub-TLV.  In such cases, the\r\n   FAD MAY be split into multiple such sub-TLVs, and the content of the\r\n   multiple FAD sub-TLVs are combined to provide a complete FAD for the\r\n   Flex-Algorithm.  In such a case, the fixed portion of the FAD (see\r\n   Section 5.1) MUST be identical in all FAD sub-TLVs for a given Flex-\r\n   Algorithm from a given IS.  ",
