This registry, titled \"IPN Node Numbers\", has been added to the list of registries associated with the Bundle Protocol.\r\n\r\nSection 3.2.2:\r\nIANA has set up a registry to manage IPN Scheme Service Numbers.

    "notes": "The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) RFC6260 defines node numbers and service numbers for the IPN naming scheme. Therefore, the registries created by RFC7116 should have been titled \"IPN Node Numbers\" and \"IPN Service Numbers\" instead of \"CBHE Node Numbers\" and \"CBHE Service Numbers\". \r\n\r\nThe IANA registries should be renamed, replacing CBHE with IPN to reflect this. This clarification is particularly important as BPv7 (RFC9171) can use the IPN naming scheme but does not have a concept of CBHE.\r\n\r\n[Update: addressed by draft-ietf-dtn-ipn-update which will update this RFC when published]",
