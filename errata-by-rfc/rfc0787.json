The\r\n purpose of OSI is to enable  an  end-user  application  activity\r\n (called an \"application  process\")  located  in  a  system  that\r\n employs OSI procedures  and  protocols  (an  \"open\"  system)  to\r\n communicate with any other appication  process  located  in  any\r\n other open system.  It is not  the  intent  of  OSI  to  specify\r\n either the functions or the implementation  details  of  systems\r\n that provide the OSI capabilities.  Communication is achieved by\r\n mutual adherence  to  agreed-upon  (standardized)  services  and\r\n protocols; the only thing that an OSI entity in a given layer in\r\n one system needs to know about an OSI entity in the  same  layer",
