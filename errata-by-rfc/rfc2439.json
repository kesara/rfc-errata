The \"unreachability/withdrawal\" of route is never suppressed and never needs to be re-evaluated in future.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   RFC 2439 isn't the easiest to read, but this erratum is not correct. Despite its name, the \"reuse list\" as described in S. 4.8.7 is used for processing timer-driven events in general, including freeing up damping structures (\"histories\"). Quoting from S. 4.8.7, \"Handling Reuse Timer Events\":\r\n\r\n                      all of the routes in the first queue will be\r\n   available for immediate reuse if reachable or the history entry could\r\n                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n   be disposed of if unreachable.\r\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nIf you have any doubt that \"history\" means \"damping structure\", take a look at S. 4.8.2:\r\n\r\n   If there is no previous stability history (the damping structure\r\n   pointer is zero), then:\r\n\r\nPresumably, you're clear on why histories for unreachable routes need to be maintained to begin with.",
