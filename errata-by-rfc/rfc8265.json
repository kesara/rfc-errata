    "notes": "Because certain characters in IdentifierClass are CONTEXTO and are not valid unless the whole string doesn't contain certain other characters (an example is ARABIC-INDIC DIGITS), it is unclear whether the context-specific rules apply to the whole username or to individual userparts.  However, section 3.5 strongly suggests that usernames (as opposed to userparts) are the matter of a higher-level protocol than this RFC.  As a result, this erratum adds the text in parentheses to clarify that context-specific rules apply to individual userparts.",
