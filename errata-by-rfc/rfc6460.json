    "notes": "The SCSV defined in RFC 5746 is not considered a \"true cipher suite\".  As a result, the inclusion of the SCSV will not result in the selection of an unexpected cipher suite.  This clarification makes it clear that the use of the SCSV does not prevent an implementation from being considered Suite B compliant.",
