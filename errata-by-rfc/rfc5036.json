However,\r\n   unless some rules are followed, it is possible for neighboring LSRs\r\n   with different advertisement modes to get into a livelock situation\r\n   where everything is functioning properly, but no labels are \r\n   distributed.  For example, consider two LSRs Ru and Rd where Ru is\r\n   the upstream LSR and Rd is the downstream LSR for a particular FEC.\r\n   In this example, Ru is using Downstream Unsolicited advertisement\r\n   mode and Rd is using Downstream on Demand mode.  In this case, Rd may\r\n   assume that Ru will request a label mapping when it wants one and Ru\r\n   may assume that Rd will advertise a label if it wants Ru to use one.\r\n   If Rd and Ru operate as suggested, no labels will be distributed from\r\n   Rd to Ru.\r\n\r\n   This livelock situation can be avoided if the following rule is\r\n   observed: an LSR operating in Downstream on Demand mode SHOULD NOT be\r\n   expected to send unsolicited mapping advertisements.
