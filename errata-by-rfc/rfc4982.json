That is potentially misleading.\r\nThe RFC should use the proper term from Mobile IP, \"Care-of Adress\".\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 4.1\r\n\r\n(2a)  underspecification; needs clarification\r\n\r\nIn the 3rd paragraph on page 5, Section 4.1 says (on mid-page 5):\r\n\r\n                                                [...].  So for instance,\r\n   the Sec value 000 would mean that the hash function used is SHA-1 and\r\n|  the 0 bits of hash2 (as defined in RFC 3972) must be 0.  Sec value of\r\n|  001 could be that the hash function used is SHA-1 and the 16 bits of\r\n   hash2 (as defined in RFC 3972) must be zero.  [...]\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps better say, to avoid possible misinterpretation:\r\n\r\n                                                [...].  So for instance,\r\n   the Sec value 000 would mean that the hash function used is SHA-1 and\r\n|  the 0 bits of hash2 (as defined in RFC 3972) must be 0.  The Sec value\r\n|  001 could indicate that the hash function used is SHA-1 and the 16\r\n|  leftmost bits of hash2 (as defined in RFC 3972) must be zero.  [...]\r\n\r\nNote: \"leftmost\" is the essential clarification; the other changes\r\n      attempt further subordinate improvements of the language.\r\n\r\n(2b)  wording/clarification\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last paragraph on page 5, Section 4.1 talks\r\nabout                     \"a last resource option\" .\r\nShouldn't that have been  \"a last resort option\"   ?",
