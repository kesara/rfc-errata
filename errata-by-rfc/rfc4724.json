    "orig_text": "Since with this proposal a new connection can cause an old one to be\r\nterminated, it might seem to open the door to denial of service\r\nattacks.  However, it is noted that unauthenticated BGP is already\r\nknown to be vulnerable to denials of service through attacks on the\r\nTCP transport.  The TCP transport is commonly protected through use\r\nof [BGP-AUTH].  Such authentication will equally protect against\r\ndenials of service through spurious new connections.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker is able to successfully open a TCP connection\r\nimpersonating a legitimate peer, the attacker's connection will\r\nreplace the legitimate one, potentially enabling the attacker to\r\nadvertise bogus routes.  We note, however, that the window for such a\r\nroute insertion attack is small since through normal operation of the\r\nprotocol the legitimate peer would open a new connection, in turn\r\ncausing the attacker's connection to be terminated.  Thus, this\r\nattack devolves to a form of denial of service.\r\n\r\nIt is thus concluded that this proposal does not change the\r\nunderlying security model (and issues) of BGP-4.\r\n\r\nWe also note that implementations may allow use of graceful restart\r\nto be controlled by configuration.
