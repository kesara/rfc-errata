The resource is exposed to the remote user in standard 1:1 chats, since servers are required to stamp the 'from' value with the full JID as per RFC 6120 ยง  8.1.2.1 (stanza-attribute-from-stamp conformance requirement).\r\nNote that the situation is different in groupchats: The resource is not required to be exposed, but when MUC is used, the presence in the channel also reveals the overall presence of the user. This is however, likely to change with future MUC replacement protocols.\r\nI'd also like to point out that RFC 6120 ยง 13.10.2. and RFC 6121 ยง 11. discuss the security considerations and provide guidance in order to prevent those leaks\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThe RFC's editors concluded that accepting the erratum would not add value.
