Three octets of padding will be added to this, giving a total length of 12 octets. The 12 octets now look like *four* records. In this case, padding is NOT appropriate.\r\n\r\nNB1 the same paragraph in section 6.1 is NOT affected, because the fixed size of the other fields dictates that the only possibility is padding of 2 octets.\r\n\r\nNB2 this situation is anticipated in IPFIX (RFC 5101), from which the additional text is taken.",
