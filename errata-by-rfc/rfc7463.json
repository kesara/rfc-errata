    "notes": "PUBLISH must not contain To tag unless sending within dialog.  The To tag (428765950880801) appears to be extraneous within the following SIP messages since there is no explanation about which dialog is being shared: section 11.7 F32, section 11.9 F32, section 11.10 F22, and section 11.14 F48.  The To/From URI values within section 11.7 F32 also should be swapped since it does not appear to be intentional and is different than the other examples indicating To tag value 428765950880801.\r\n\r\nSection 11.4 F2 also has To tag issues since a To tag must be present to comply with RFC 3261.  Section 11.6 F28 also should not be missing a To tag.",
