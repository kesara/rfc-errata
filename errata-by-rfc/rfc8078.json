    "notes": "RFC 7344 defines both CDS and CDNSKEY record wire and presentation format to be identical to DS and DNSKEY wire and presentation format defined in RFC 4034.\r\n\r\nIn case of CDNSKEY record, RFC 4034 section 2.2 requires that:\r\n> The Public Key field MUST be represented as a Base64 encoding of the Public Key.\r\n\r\nAs Base64 encoding encodes 6 bits into one character, one character alone can never be a valid Base64 sequence. The proper encoding of one-byte long sequence with binary value of 00 is AA==.\r\n\r\nIn case of CDS record, RFC 4034 section 5.3 requires that:\r\n> The Digest MUST be represented as a sequence of case-insensitive hexadecimal digits\r\n\r\nAlthough the value of a single 0 fulfils this requirement per se, it's not properly parsable by many implementations since it is expected to be even number of hex digits to align with octet boundaries in the wire format. So proper form of CDS record should contain two zeroes in place of the digest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ AD Note: Discussion on the DNSOP list: - https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsop/current/msg20267.html ] ",
