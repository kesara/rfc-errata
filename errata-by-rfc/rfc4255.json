These RFCs thus (arguably) update RFC 4255. It would be helpful to have such an \"Updated by\" noticed in the header of RFC 4255.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nArguably, those RFCs do not update RFC 4255, given that much of the point of having an IANA registry is to be able to allocate new values without updating the original document.  I do not believe there is a convention of using an Updates relationship solely to indicate that a codepoint has been allocated from an IANA registry.",
