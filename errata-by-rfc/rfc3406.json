(See also http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4395; this is the same situation.)\r\n\r\nIf this erratum report is approved, BCP number 66 should be retired, as BCP 115 (see link above).\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThis is likely correct. However, this is because the \"RFC has not been processed in accordance with the rules governing the proposed change to the RFC metadata.\" (See IESG statement on changes to metadata in errata.) Making the suggested change would potentially invalidate references to BCP 66. The IESG and RFC Editor should decide best course of action. ",
