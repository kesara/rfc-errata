    "section": "99 It appears that the ABNF grammar for textual representations of IPv6 addresses as detailed in Appendix B of RFC 2373 is not correct in its treatment of IPv6 addresses with a trailing IPv4 address.  Specifically, section 2.2.3 of the RFC states that:",
    "orig_text": " \"::13.1.83.3\" \r\n",
    "correct_text": "      IPv6address = dcolon | hexpart\r\n\r\n      IPv4address = 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT\r\n      IPv6prefix  = hexpart \"/\" 1*2DIGIT\r\n\r\n      dcolon  = \"::\" | \"::\" hexseq [ \":\" IPv4address ] | \"::\" [ IPv4address ]\r\n      hexpart = hexseq | hexseq \":\" IPv4address | hexseq dcolon\r\n      hexseq  = hex4 *( \":\" hex4)\r\n      hex4    = 1*4HEXDIG",
    "notes": "According to the grammar in Appendix B, this is not a valid IPv6\r\naddress; there is no provision for a double colon followed by an IPv4\r\naddress.  However, the grammar does allow for a double colon, followed by\r\na colon, followed by an IPv4 address.  In other words, \":::13.1.83.3\" is a\r\nvalid address according to the grammar and \"::13.1.83.3\" is not.\r\n\r\nI blame the discrepancy on the grammar simply because I feel that the\r\nintent of the RFC was clearly to prefer two colons over three colons\r\nbefore a trailing IPv4 address.  This seems to match the behavior of\r\nexisting applications.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThis RFC has been replaced by RFC 3513   ",
