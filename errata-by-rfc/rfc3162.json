Those documents use data types for the \"value\" field of RADIUS attributes that have not been defined in RFC 2865.  As such, they should either:\r\n\r\na) make it clear that they define a new data type, and be marked as \"Updates: 2865\"\r\n\r\n  or\r\n\r\nb) use the data types in RFC 2865.\r\n\r\n  Or even better, maintain an internally consistent set of beliefs, and leave RFC 3162 alone.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThe common terminology is known by RADIUS implementers. Every RADIUS implementor \"knows what this means\".  i.e. \"Address\" in RFC 2865 means \"ipaddr\", and \"Address\" in RFC 3162 means \"ipv6addr\". A change now would create further confusion. \r\n\r\n   ",
