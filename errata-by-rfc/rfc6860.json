Consequently,\r\n   when a Designated Router builds an intra-area-prefix-LSA referencing\r\n   a network-LSA, these IPv6 address prefixes will be omitted.\r\n",
    "notes": "The change essentially reverts the paragraph back to the formulation from http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ospf-prefix-hiding-05#section-3 . Most importantly, the term \"router-LSA\" is replaced with \"link-LSA\", as there are already no prefixes carried in OSFPv3 router-LSA whatsoever, and the removal of transit-network prefixes influences link-LSAs and intra-area-prefix-LSAs. Also, the change reintroduces the keyword \"MUST\" that underlines the behavior that is crucial to the proper implementation of the feature.",
