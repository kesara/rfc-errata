    "notes": "Usage of b64token is confusing. Definition is self explanatory but could be easily confused with Base64.\r\n\r\nRFC7235 defines token68. Following some old RFC draft discussions (http://w3-org.9356.n7.nabble.com/p7-rename-b64token-to-token68-to-avoid-misunderstandings-td108256.html) I found that b64token was renamed to token68.\r\n\r\nI believe it's appropriate to use naming of token68 (instead of b64token) in RFC6750. So that it is less confusing as well as refers to an existing standard.",
