    "orig_text": "(1)  typo (technical error)\r\n\r\nWithin Section 4.2.2.2. of RFC 4956, the last sentence of the\r\nparagraph on top of page 8 contains a wrong RCODE value.\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n\r\n                v\r\n                                 [...].  In particular, a NOERROR/NODATA\r\n|  (i.e., RCODE=3, but the answer section is empty) response to a DS\r\n   query may be proven by an Opt-In flagged covering NSEC record, rather\r\n   than an NSEC record matching the query name.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                v\r\n                                 [...].  In particular, a NOERROR/NODATA\r\n|  (i.e., RCODE=0, but the answer section is empty) response to a DS\r\n   query may be proven by an Opt-In flagged covering NSEC record, rather\r\n   than an NSEC record matching the query name.\r\n\r\nRationale: See RCODE list in RFC 1035 [1], page 27, and RFC 2181 [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  missing article\r\n\r\nStill on page 8, an article is missing in the third bullet\r\nin Section 4.2.4 .\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n\r\n   o  sending a NOERROR/NODATA response when query type is DS and the\r\n|     covering NSEC is tagged as Opt-In, unless NSEC record's owner name\r\n      matches the query name.\r\n                                               ^\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   o  sending a NOERROR/NODATA response when query type is DS and the\r\n|     covering NSEC is tagged as Opt-In, unless the NSEC record's owner\r\n      name matches the query name.\r\n                                               ^^^^^\r\n\r\n(3)  inconsistency\r\n\r\nThere's a small inconsistency in the presentation of DNS querys\r\n(and responses) in Section 6.\r\nIn almost all instances, in that context the text gives domain\r\nnames with the DNS 'root label', the trailing dot.\r\nYet, in the second line of the first paragraph on page 10,\r\nthis dot is missing twice.\r\n\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n\r\n   In this example, a query for a signed RRset (e.g., \"FIRST-\r\n|  SECURE.EXAMPLE A\") or a secure delegation (\"WWW.SECOND-SECURE.EXAMPLE\r\n   A\") will result in a standard DNSSEC response.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   In this example, a query for a signed RRset (e.g., \"FIRST-\r\n|  SECURE.EXAMPLE. A\") or a secure delegation (\"WWW.SECOND-\r\n|  SECURE.EXAMPLE. A\") will result in a standard DNSSEC response.\r\n                 ^\r\n\r\n(4)  text truncation\r\n\r\nIn Section 9, on top of page 13, the list of acknowledged people\r\napparently has been truncated.\r\n\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n          v\r\n|     Mats Kolkman, Edward Lewis, Ted Lindgreen, Rip Loomis, Bill\r\n      Manning, Dan Massey, Scott Rose, Mike Schiraldi, Jakob Schlyter,\r\n      Brian Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe -09 draft had the following list:\r\n\r\n|     Mats Dufberg, Miek Gieben, Olafur Gudmudsson, Bob Halley, Olaf\r\n      Kolkman, Edward Lewis, Ted Lindgreen, Rip Loomis, Bill Manning,\r\n      Dan Massey, Scott Rose, Mike Schiraldi, Jakob Schlyter, Brian\r\n      Wellington.\r\n\r\nAFAICS, most probably the draft was o.k. and the bulk of the first\r\nline of that list has been lost in the publication process.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  references\r\n\r\nRFC 3655 [3] and RFC 3090 [10] have been incorporated into, and\r\nformally been obsoleted by RFC 4033..35 [4][5][6].\r\n\r\nIMHO, it is therefore inappropriate to list [3] as a Normative\r\nReference in Section 10.1, and it it of questionable benefit\r\nto list both [3] and [10] at all in Section 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nI apologize for not having caught and reported items (1)..(3) and\r\n(5) when I once studied the -09 draft version of the document;\r\nitem (4) is new.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend to post an RFC Errata Note covering at least\r\nitems (1) and (4).\r\n",
