    "notes": "Many JCE providers including OpenJDK, BouncyCastle, Conscrypt have a bug to use 12 bytes authentication tag (aes-ICVlen) as default if the code path [1] uses CMS. According to Ferguson's attack (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comments/CWC-GCM/Ferguson2.pdf), if a user encrypts 2^32 block length message, then 12 bytes authentication tag length has only 96 - 32 = 64 bits security which is not good enough nowadays. Furthermore, once a forgery happens then authentication is leaked.\r\n\r\n[1] In other code paths, all providers use 16 bytes authentication tag as default.\r\n\r\n------\r\nAD Note: through on list discussions, it is clear this errata should be rejected.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this errata must be rejected.
