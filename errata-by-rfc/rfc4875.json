[...]\r\n\r\nThe RFC should say, inserting the missing article and correcting\r\nthe reference to point to Section 5.1 :\r\n\r\n|  The S2L sub-LSP flow descriptor has the same format as the S2L\r\n|  sub-LSP descriptor in section 5.1 with the difference that a\r\n   P2MP_SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE object is used in place of a P2MP\r\n   SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  Section 6.2 -- missing article\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of Section 6.2, on mid-page 17, says:\r\n\r\n                                 [...].  When the integrity bit is set\r\n|  in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, Resv message MUST NOT be sent\r\n   upstream until all Resv messages have been received from the\r\n   downstream neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                                 [...].  When the integrity bit is set\r\n|  in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE object, a Resv message MUST NOT be sent\r\n   upstream until all Resv messages have been received from the\r\n   downstream neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Section 8.2 -- text duplication and inconsistency\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of Section 8.2 (on page 23),\r\n\r\n   A transit LSR sets the Sub-Group Originator ID in the FILTER_SPEC\r\n   object(s) of a Resv message to the value that was received in the\r\n   corresponding Path message.  If any of the incoming Resv messages\r\n   corresponding to a single Path message carry a RESV_CONFIRM object,\r\n   then the LSR MUST include a RESV_CONFIRM object in the corresponding\r\n   Resv message that it sends upstream.  If the Sub-Group Originator ID\r\n   is its own address, then it MUST set the receiver address in the\r\n   RESV_CONFIRM object to this address, else it MUST propagate the\r\n   object unchanged.\r\n\r\nshould be deleted entirely !\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n  The first two sentences in this paragraph are repeated almost\r\n  literally in the subsequent (third) paragraph of the section.\r\n  The third (last) sentence above essentially is superseeded, in\r\n  a more precise manner, by the second and the third bullet at the\r\n  bottom of page 23.\r\n  But, perhaps most importantly, the first bullet there handles a\r\n  subcase not covered by, and hence mis-specified, by that sentence!\r\n\r\n  Apparently, the lower half of page 23 is a revised revision of\r\n  the quoted second paragraph, which should have been deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  Section 10.2 -- clarification including mismatched angle\r\n                     brackets, word omissions, and punctuation\r\n\r\nWithin Section 10.2, the third paragraph on page 26 says:\r\n\r\n   [...]\r\n|  A newly received Path message that matches SESSION object and Sender\r\n   Tunnel Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> with existing Path\r\n|  state carrying the same or different Sub-Group_ID, referred to Sub-\r\n|  Group_ID(n) is processed as follows:\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   [...]\r\n|  A newly received Path message that matches in SESSION object and\r\n|  <Sender Tunnel Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> with\r\n|  existing Path state carrying the same or a different Sub-Group_ID,\r\n|  referred to as Sub-Group_ID(n), is processed as follows:\r\n\r\nOr even better, a bit reworded for enhanced readability:\r\n\r\n   [...]\r\n|  A newly received Path message with SESSION object and <Sender Tunnel\r\n|  Address, LSP ID, Sub-Group Originator ID> tuple matching existing\r\n|  Path state carrying the same or a different Sub-Group_ID, referred to\r\n|  as Sub-Group_ID(n), is processed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  Section 11.3\r\n\r\nEstablished language in IETF (and other) publications is \"tear down\",\r\nnot simply \"tear\", when it comes to the deletion of connections etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while not really wrong, I would have appreciated the\r\nfollowing changes:\r\n\r\n- in the 5th line of the 3rd paragraph of Section 11.3 (on page 28):\r\n       \"It does not tear any other branches ...\"\r\n  -->  \"It does not tear down any other branches ...\"\r\n\r\n- in the 5th paragraph of Section 11.3, in the last text line on p.28:\r\n       \"... that are explicitely torn ...\"\r\n  -->  \"... that are explicitely torn down ...\"\r\n\r\n[ I note this minor issue just for consideration in the preparation\r\n  of future / derived work. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)  Section 15.1.2 -- another typo\r\n\r\nOn page 31, in the 6th line of the first paragraph of Section 15.1.2,\r\n\r\n  \"being backed- up\"  should be  \"being backed up\"\r\n\r\n[ The hyphenated form, \"backed-up\" is only appropriate in adverbial\r\n  context, e.g., \"a backed-up LSP\". ]\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)  Section 16 -- typo/grammar\r\n\r\nWithin Section 16, the third paragraph on page 34 says:\r\n\r\n   There maybe overhead for an operator to configure ...\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n   There may be overhead for an operator to configure ...\r\n            ^\r\n\r\nRationale: Otherwise, the sentence lacks of a verb.\r\n\r\n\r\n(10)  Section 17 -- bad internal reference\r\n\r\nWithin Section 17, in the second paragraph on page 35, the reader\r\nis referred to:\r\n                 \"Figure 2 in section 24\"\r\nwhich should be:\r\n                 \"Figure 2 in Appendix A\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(11)  Section 18 -- typo (text reformatting problem ?)\r\n\r\nWithin Section 18, at the bottom of page 35,\r\n    \"re- merge\"  should be  \"re-merge\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(12)  Section 19\r\n\r\n(12a) -- lack of precision / completeness\r\n\r\nThe sub-sections of Section 19 mostly remain a bit unspecific with\r\nrespect to Class *numbers* (only Section 19.3 does supply these),\r\nwhereas C-Type values always are specified fully.\r\n\r\nFor uniformity and completeness, and for the ease of the reader,\r\nthe following changes/amendments (determined after IANA lookup)\r\nshould be applied -- adopting the style of the RFC text from\r\nSection 19.3 --, to the lines immediately above the class data\r\nstructure diagrams (I use abbreviated, diff-like notation):\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.1.1 (on mid-page 39):\r\n\r\n   Class =

C-Type = 14\r\n--\r\n   SESSION Class = 1, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 14\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.2.1 (on top of page 41):\r\n\r\n   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 12\r\n--\r\n   SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type = 12\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.2.2 (on top of page 42):\r\n\r\n   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 13\r\n--\r\n   SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11, P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type = 13\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.4.1 (at the bottom of page 43):\r\n\r\n   Class = FILTER_SPEC, P2MP LSP_IPv4 C-Type = 12\r\n--\r\n   FILTER_SPEC Class = 10, P2MP LSP_IPv4 C-Type = 12\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.4.2 (at the top of page 44):\r\n\r\n   Class = FILTER_SPEC, P2MP LSP_IPv6 C-Type = 13\r\n--\r\n   FILTER_SPEC Class = 10, P2MP LSP_IPv6 C-Type = 13\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.5 (on page 44):\r\n\r\n                       The class of the P2MP SERO is the same as the\r\n   SERO defined in [RFC4873].\r\n--\r\n                       The class of the P2MP SERO is 200, as assigned\r\n   for the SERO in [RFC4873].\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.6 (on page 44):\r\n\r\n                The class of the P2MP SRRO is the same as the SRRO\r\n   defined in [RFC4873].\r\n--\r\n                The class of the P2MP SRRO is 201, as assigned for\r\n   the SRRO in [RFC4873].\r\n\r\n\r\n(12b) -- unusual presentation\r\n\r\nIt is unusual to present the explanations of fields in a diagram\r\nin a sequence that does not correspond to the sequence of the\r\nfields therein.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would have appreciated it to find ...\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.2.1 (on page 41) the explanation for \"LSP ID\"\r\n   not at the bottom of the list, but at the second position,\r\n   below the explanation for \"IPv4 tunnel sender address\";\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\no  in Section 19.2.2 (on page 42) the explanation for \"LSP ID\"\r\n   not at the bottom of the list, but at the second position,\r\n   below the explanation for \"IPv6 tunnel sender address\";\r\n\r\n\r\n(13)  Section 20.2 -- similar to (12a)\r\n\r\nContrary to Section 20.1, Section 20.2 is silent about the class\r\nnumbers.  As in item (12a) above, for consistency and completeness,\r\nthe following changes should be applied, in accordance with the\r\nstyle of the IANA registry file and Section 20.1 :\r\n\r\n   Class Name = SESSION\r\n--\r\n     1  Class Name = SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n   Class Name = SENDER_TEMPLATE\r\n--\r\n    11  Class Name = SENDER_TEMPLATE\r\n\r\n\r\n   Class Name = FILTER_SPEC\r\n--\r\n    10  Class Name = FILTER_SPEC\r\n\r\n\r\n   Class Name = SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE (Defined in [RFC4873])\r\n--\r\n   200  Class Name = SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n   Class Name = SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE (Defined in [RFC4873])\r\n--\r\n   201  Class Name = SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n[ Note:\r\n  I have deleted the repeated refs to RFC 4873 for uniformity;\r\n  this information is already present in Section 19, it might\r\n  only have been interesting here for the IANA in the I-D phase. ]\r\n",
