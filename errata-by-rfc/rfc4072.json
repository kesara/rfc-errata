    "notes": "In the original text, the first occurrence of the string \"Key-Name\" apparently is meant to refer to the actual name of the key, rather than an AVP identifier, while the next two occurrences are obviously typos, since no Key-Name AVP is defined in the document.  Also, the term \"silently discard\" is typically used in reference to messages; with reference to a single AVP, \"silently ignore\" seems more appropriate.",
