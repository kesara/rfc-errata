Furthermore, for\r\n   logical consistency, \"resource type\" had to be replaced by\r\n   \"resource\" in the last line, to maintain the required\r\n   uniqueness property of '3gpp' URNs.\r\n \r\nb) Even the corrected statement merely is a simple instantiation of\r\n   the general definition in RFC 2141 (Section 2, page 1), plus\r\n   giving an alias name (<3gpp-urn>) to the NSSs of '3gpp' URNs.\r\n\r\n   However, it does not cure the apparent underspecification:\r\n\r\n   The current URN Namespace registration template per BCP 66,\r\n   RFC3406, serves for \"... providing a mechanism for disclosing \r\n   [the] structure of the URN namespace ...\" (page 11 of RFC 3406),\r\n   but the quoted clause, as it stands, does *not*\r\n   \"outline any structural features of identifiers in this namespace\"\r\n   (p. 12 of RFC 3406).\r\n",
