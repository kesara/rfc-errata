    "notes": "The upper limit of the ranges of upsShutdownAfterDelay and upsStartupAfterDelay points to the intention to use a 32-bit signed integer.\r\nThe biggest positive value of a 32-bit singed integer, however, is 2147483647. On a 32-Bit system the upper range given within RFC1628 (2147483648) is so large that is is unsigned, which conflicts with the limitation to 32 bits. \r\nAs 2147483648 seconds is more than 68 years, it seems preferable to change this to 2147483647, loosing 1 second but gaining the ability to be implemented with 32 bits.",
