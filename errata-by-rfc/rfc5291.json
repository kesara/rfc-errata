    "notes": "RFC5291 does not specify how the ORF capability is supposed to be used\r\nin conjunction with multiple enabled AFI/SAFI combinations.  The text\r\ncan be interpreted as either \"one capability instance will be sent,\r\ncarrying multiple blocks as described in Figure 3\" or as \"the\r\ncapability will be supplied in more than instance\".\r\n\r\nNote also that RFC3392 [BGP-CAP] Section 4 reads:\r\n\r\n   BGP speakers MAY include more than one instance of a capability (as\r\n   identified by the Capability Code) with non-zero Capability Length\r\n   field, but with different Capability Value, and either the same or\r\n   different Capability Length.  Processing of these capability\r\n   instances is specific to the Capability Code and MUST be described in\r\n   the document introducing the new capability.\r\n\r\nLatter description of how multiple instances of the capability are to be\r\nprocessed - albeit relatively obvious - is nowhere to be found in RFC5291.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully requesting a clarification,\r\n\r\nDavid Lamparter\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThis is beyond the scope of an errata system to address.\r\n\r\nI think that the right process is for the WG to decide the answer\r\nand if necessary for someone to write up a short update to\r\nRFC5291\r\n\r\nI have therefore rejected this errata.\r\n\r\nThe thread in the IDR list starts at\r\nhttp://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg12075.html\r\n",
