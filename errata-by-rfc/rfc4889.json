Another example\r\n|  is to make use of proxy Home Agent such as defined in the global Home\r\n   Agent to Home Agent (HAHA) protocol [14].  A proxy Home Agent acts as\r\n   a Home Agent for the Mobile Node, and acts as a Mobile Node for the\r\n   Home Agent, Correspondent Node, Correspondent Router, and other\r\n   proxies.  In particular, the proxy Home Agent terminates the MRHA\r\n   tunnel and the associated encryption, extracts the packets, and re-\r\n   encapsulates them to the destination.  In this case, proxy Home\r\n   Agents are distributed in the infrastructure and each Mobile Router\r\n   binds to the closest proxy.
