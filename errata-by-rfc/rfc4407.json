Header fields\r\n   that are otherwise relevant but contain only whitespace are ignored\r\n   and treated as if they were not present.\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n   For the purposes of this algorithm, a header field is \"non-empty\" if\r\n|  and only if its body contains any non-whitespace characters.

Thus, anyone using\r\n   the PRA for any purpose MUST be aware that the headers from which it\r\n   is derived might be fraudulent, malicious, malformed, and/or\r\n   incorrect.  [...]\r\n\r\nshould say (apply item (3) above twice):\r\n\r\n   The PRA, as described by this document, is extracted from message\r\n|  header fields that have historically not been verified.

[...]\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of Section 3,\r\n\r\n   A message's PRA will often be extracted from a header field that is\r\n   not normally displayed by existing mail user agent software.  If the\r\n   PRA is used as part of a mechanism to authenticate the message's\r\n   origin, the message SHOULD NOT be displayed with an indication of its\r\n   authenticity (positive or negative) without the PRA header field also\r\n   being displayed.\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n   A message's PRA will often be extracted from a header field that is\r\n   not normally displayed by existing mail user agent software.

    "notes": "The RFC adds to the trouble of mis-used\r\nterminology from the Internet Message Format (IMF) framework;\r\nit repeatedly confuses the precisely defined terms, 'header',\r\n'header field', and 'header field body'.\r\n\r\nThe most recent summary of the IETF standardized IMF terminology\r\n(from RFC 2822 et al.) can be found on page 3 of RFC 4249:\r\n\r\n\r\n 3.1.1.  Standard Terminology\r\n\r\n   Terms related to the Internet Message Format are defined in\r\n   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields should use\r\n   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity and\r\n*  avoid confusion.  For example, a \"header\" [I1.FYI18], [N2.RFC2822] is\r\n*  comprised of \"header fields\", each of which has a \"field name\" and\r\n*  usually has a \"field body\".  Each message may have multiple\r\n*  \"headers\", viz. a message header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.\r\n\r\n*  A message header has a Date header field (i.e., a field with field\r\n*  name \"Date\").  However, there is no \"Date header\"; use of such non-\r\n*  standard terms is likely to lead to confusion, possibly resulting in\r\n*  interoperability failures of implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor details, see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of RFC 2822 and other places.\r\nI also recommend the terminology sections in RFC 4021 and RFC 3864.\r\n\r\nfrom pending",
