This is the number of rows in isnsRegPortalTable.\"\r\n       ^^^^^^^^\r\n(2b)\r\nFor isnsNumPortalGroups, the RFC says:\r\n\r\n          DESCRIPTION\r\n|     \"The current total number of Portal Groups registered in\r\n|      iSNS.  This is the number of rows in isnsRegPgTable.\"\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps better say:\r\n                                                              vvvvv\r\n          DESCRIPTION\r\n|     \"The current total number of Portal Groups registered in this\r\n|      iSNS instance.  This is the number of rows in isnsRegPgTable.\"\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n(2d)  isnsDdIscsiMemberName  (page 36)\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the isnsDdIscsiMemberName OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration says:\r\n\r\n       [...]\r\n       The node index used for a specific node name is only\r\n       persistent across iSNS Server reinitializations for nodes\r\n       that are in a Discovery Domain (DD) or are registered\r\n|      control nodes.  This value is only required during row\r\n|      creation if the storage node is not yet registered in the\r\n|      iSNS Server instance.  If the storage node is not yet\r\n|      registered, then the iSCSI Name MUST be provided with the\r\n|      iSCSI node index during row creation in order to create the\r\n|      1-to-1 mapping.\"\r\n\r\nThe tagged text makes almost no sense here, and should better have\r\nbeen omitted, because row creation (and deletion) via SNMP in the\r\nisnsDdIscsiMemberTable is not supported by (this version of) the\r\nMIB module.\r\n\r\nHence, The RFC should better simply say:\r\n       [...]\r\n       The node index used for a specific node name is only\r\n       persistent across iSNS Server reinitializations for nodes\r\n       that are in a Discovery Domain (DD) or are registered\r\n|      control nodes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(2e)  isnsDdPortalMemberEntry  (page 37)\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the isnsDdPortalMemberEntry OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration says:\r\n\r\n      \"Each entry indicates an explicit addition of a portal to a\r\n       discovery domain.  The explicit addition of an entity portal\r\n       to a discovery domain indicates the portal is preferred for\r\n       access to nodes of the entity for this discovery domain.\r\n       Registered Portal Group objects are used in iSCSI to\r\n|      indicate mapping of portals to nodes across all discovery\r\n       domains.  Portals that have been explicitly mapped to a\r\n|      discovery domain will be returned as part of a query that\r\n       is scoped to that discovery domain.  If no portal of an\r\n       entity has been explicitly mapped to a discovery domain,\r\n       then all portals of the entity that provide access to a\r\n       storage node are returned as part of a query.  The table\r\n       indexes are the server instance, the DD ID of the Discovery\r\n       Domain, and the Portal Index of the portal.\"\r\n\r\nIn the coupled context od SNMP and iSNS, the bare term 'query' is\r\nambiguous and its use might lead to some confusion.\r\nClosely reading all other text in the document related to the\r\nDD Portal Membership table, isnsDdPortalMemberTable, has indicated\r\nto me that it makes only sense to talk about iSNS queries in the\r\ncontext of the second tag mark above.\r\nFurther, IMHO an article is missing in the first tagged line above.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the RFC should better say:\r\n\r\n      \"Each entry indicates an explicit addition of a portal to a\r\n       discovery domain.  The explicit addition of an entity portal\r\n       to a discovery domain indicates the portal is preferred for\r\n       access to nodes of the entity for this discovery domain.\r\n       Registered Portal Group objects are used in iSCSI to\r\n|      indicate the mapping of portals to nodes across all discovery\r\n       domains.

    "orig_text": "(2f)  isnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable / isnsRegEntityNumObjectsEntry\r\n      (page 44)\r\n\r\nStudying the MIB module, it turns out that the\r\nisnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable is a (dense) augmentation\r\nof the isnsRegEntityTable : a conceptual row in the former\r\nmust be instantiated if an only if the corresponding row\r\n(with identical index values) is instantiated in the latter.\r\n\r\nTherefore, according to the strong recommendation '(1)' given\r\nin Section 7.8.1 of the first part of STD 58, RFC 2578, the\r\nisnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable should be formally represented\r\nas an augmentation of the isnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable.\r\n\r\nThis means that, in the isnsRegEntityNumObjectsEntry OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration, where the RFC says ...\r\n\r\n      isnsRegEntityNumObjectsEntry    OBJECT-TYPE\r\n          [...]\r\n|         INDEX   { isnsServerIndex,\r\n|                   isnsRegEntityIndex }\r\n          ::= { isnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable 1 }\r\n\r\n... it should have specified:\r\n\r\n      isnsRegEntityNumObjectsEntry    OBJECT-TYPE\r\n          [...]\r\n|         AUGMENTS { isnsRegEntityEntry }\r\n          ::= { isnsRegEntityNumObjectsTable 1 }\r\n\r\nNote that the similar relationship between the isnsNumObjectsTable\r\nand the isnsServerTable has correctly reflected in the RFC; the\r\nisnsNumObjectsEntry OBJECT-TYPE declaration already contains the\r\nclause:\r\n          AUGMENTS { isnsServerEntry }\r\n\r\n\r\n(2g)  isnsRegIscsiNodeAuthMethod  (page 55)\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the isnsRegIscsiNodeAuthMethod OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration says:\r\n\r\n|     \"This attribute contains a null-terminated string containing\r\n       UTF-8 text listing the iSCSI authentication methods enabled\r\n       for this iSCSI Node, in order of preference.  The text\r\n       values used to identify iSCSI authentication methods are\r\n       embedded in this string attribute and delineated by a\r\n       comma.  The text values are identical to those found in\r\n       RFC 3720 - iSCSI.  Additional vendor-specific text values\r\n       are also possible.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very unusual.  'null-terminated' have been introduced\r\nin some very popular programming languages in place of length\r\ncounts for string variables.  (Some people believe this has been\r\none of the most serious errors ever in the history of programming\r\nlanguages, because it makes transparent strings (with 0x00 allowed)\r\nimpossible, and practice sadly has proven it is a pathway to the\r\nhell of very many security flaws.)\r\nASN.1 OCTET-STRINGs are counted strings, and the SMIv2 *is* a qualified\r\nsubset of ASN.1.  SnmpAdminString is a proper subtype of OCTET-STRING.\r\nHence, there is no need to include a terminating null into an object\r\nof type SnmpAdminString.\r\nApparently, this has been recognized throughout this MIB module,\r\nwith explicit explanations for all OCTET-STRING (SIZE (0..223))\r\ntyped objects.\r\n\r\nThis single deviation from standard practice is a significant\r\ninconsistency in the MIB module and it might well lead to\r\ninteroperability problems if it is not recognized by implementors!\r\n\r\n\r\n(2h)  object names in the isnsNotificationsInfo branch\r\n      (pages 64/65, used later on as well)\r\n\r\nIt is common practice, and makes life easier, to have object names\r\nbuilt in a manner that reflects the OID tree: most significant\r\npart(s) left, finer granularity right.\r\n\r\nThe object names introduced in most parts of the MIB module conform\r\nto that rule.  But unfortunately, the object names in the\r\nisnsNotificationsInfo branch are not built this way.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it would have been much more preferable to have the\r\nfollowing name changes applied (unfortunately, it's too late\r\nnow for such modification):\r\n\r\n   isnsAddressNotificationType   -->  isnsNotificationAddressType\r\n\r\n   isnsAddressNotification       -->  isnsNotificationAddress\r\n\r\n   isnsTcpPortNotification       -->  isnsNotificationTcpPort\r\n\r\n   isnsUdpPortNotification       -->  isnsNotificationUdpPort",
