    "orig_text": "In the module heading and in the IMPORTS clause of the ASN.1 module\r\nof RFC 4073 (Appendix A on page 7), the textual label for the\r\nsub-identifier 9 of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1 is\r\nspelled \"pkcs-9(9)\".\r\nBut, ALL other (#=4) appearances of this same sub-identifier in the\r\ntext of RFC 4073 use the spelling \"pkcs9(9)\" (without the '-').\r\n\r\nI've tried to resolve this inconsistency going \"back to the roots\",\r\nand unfortunately found a big mess! (see detailed list below)\r\n\r\nBasically, PKCS#9 v2.0 from RSA Labs and its ASCII-fication RFC 2985\r\nshould be considered the primary reference because this spec contains\r\nthe definition of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.113549.1.9 .\r\nThere, the spelling consistently is  \"pkcs-9(9)\" .\r\n\r\nThis notation style is strictly followed in all PKCS publications\r\nfrom RSA (as far as I could verify), and in most RFCs related to\r\nPKCS/CMS/PKIX. I've found 24 RFCs of this kind.\r\n\r\nBut there are two RFCs using the spelling \"pkcs9(9)\" (without the '-')\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I found 8 RFCs - including RFC 4073 and your RFC 4049,\r\nas well - using both spellings mixed without any recognizable pattern.\r\n\r\nHere are the detailed results of my RFC scan - with shortened titles,\r\nand some content oriented grouping applied:\r\n\r\n'pkcs-9(9)' only :\r\n----------------\r\n  2985 - PKCS #9\r\n\r\n  2311 - S/MIME v.2 Message Specification,\r\n  2312 - S/MIME v.2 Certificate Handling,\r\n  2633 - S/MIME v.3 Message Specification\r\n  3114 - Company Classifying Policy via S/MIME Security Label\r\n  3183 - Domain Security Services using S/MIME\r\n  3850 - S/MIME v.3.1 Certificate Handling\r\n  3855 - Transporting S/MIME Objects in X.400\r\n\r\n  2459 - PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile  [ obsoleted by: 3280 ]\r\n  3280 - PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile\r\n\r\n  2511 - PKIX Certificate Request Messages\r\n  3029 - PKIX Data Validation and Certification Server Protocols\r\n\r\n  2797 - Certificate Mgmt Messages over CMS\r\n  3161 - PKIX Time-Stamp Protocol\r\n\r\n  3125 - Electronic Signature Policies\r\n\r\n  3211 - Password-based Encryption for CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3369+3370 ]\r\n  3274 - Compressed Data Content for CMS\r\n\r\n  2875 - D-H Proof-of-Posession\r\n  3185 - Reuse of CMS CEKs\r\n  3217 - Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping\r\n  3370 - CMS Algorithms\r\n  3537 - HMAC Key Wrapping with 3DES or AES\r\n  3560 - RSAES-OAEP Key Transport in CMS\r\n  3565 - Use of AES Encryption in CMS\r\n\r\n'pkcs9(9)' only :\r\n---------------\r\n  3657 - Use of Camellia Encryption in CMS\r\n  4010 - Use of SEED Encryption in CMS\r\n\r\nmixed spelling :\r\n--------------\r\n  2630 - CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3369+3370 ]\r\n  3369 - CMS  [ obsoleted by: 3852 ]\r\n  3852 - CMS\r\n\r\n  2634 - Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME\r\n  3851 - S/MIME v.3.1 Message Specification\r\n\r\n  3126 - Electronic Signature Formats for lon-term signatures\r\n\r\n  4049 - BinaryTime\r\n\r\n  4073 - Multiple Content in CMS\r\n\r\nNote: I fear that there might exist similar inconsistencies for other\r\n====  object identifiers (verification: t.b.d.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, what should be done?\r\nIt certainly would be VERY preferable to follow identifier naming\r\nliterally, always and strictly, once published in a normatively\r\nreferable way.\r\nAt least, we should ensure a consistent use of already defined\r\nidentifiers to be followed in future IETF publications.\r\nAdditionally, it might be considered to post Errata Notes for some\r\n(or all non-obsoleted) RFCs in the 2nd and 3rd category above\r\n(i.e., RFCs 2634, 3126, 3657, 3851, 3852, 4010, 4049, 4073).\r\n",
