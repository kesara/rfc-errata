It should be marked 0+, to allow packets to contain both E212 and REALM values for Operator-Name\r\n\r\n- there is no discussion of Operator-Name in Access-Accept.  So it's not clear why the table lists 0-1 for that packet\r\n\r\n- The table allows 0+ for Accounting-Request, so it's not clear why it's 0-1 for Access-Request",
