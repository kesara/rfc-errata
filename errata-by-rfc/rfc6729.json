The order of additional clauses may need to be defined for proper parsing to determine validity of messages for spam classification or determination of other subversive purposes (as invalid values may indicate bad messages).\r\n\r\n(See also the note filed in errata #1 filed for RFC 6710.)\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nRFC 5321 gives no indication that the order of clauses in the Additional-Registered-Clauses group matters, and, indeed, the order should not matter.  Each clause has a unique (registered) atom, and they can be parsed unambiguously from those.   ",
