    "notes": "In the original text, we forgot to mention the value of the BGP capability code.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nRFC 5291 describes The Outbound Route Filter (ORF) Capability for BGP. According to RFC 5291, when two BGP speakers initiate a session between one another and they intend to exchange ORFs of any type, they must advertise the ORF capability. The ORF capability is registered with a value of 3 in the IANA BGP Capability Code Registry. The ORF capability also includes a list of ORF types that the BGP speaker can send and/or receive. IANA also maintains a BGP Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) Types registry.\r\n\r\nRFC 7543 describes a new ORF type, called the Covering Prefix ORF (CP-ORF). RFC 7543 should conform to generic ORF procedures defined in RFC 5291. Specifically, when two BGP speakers initiate a session between one another and they intend to exchange CP-ORFs, they must advertise the ORF capability (value 3). The ORF capability must include CP-ORF (value 65) in the ORF type list.",
