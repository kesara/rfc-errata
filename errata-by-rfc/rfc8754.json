    "notes": "When only one single Segment is included in the SRH, the last entry will be 0 forever, so a segment endpoint node cannot specify whether the last Segment is included or removed from the SRH. \r\n\r\nAs defined in section 2.1, only when the header length of SRH larger then (0+1)*2, the TLVs will be processed. \r\n1.\tWhen the Segment is removed, Segment Lefts = Last Entry = 0, each segment endpoint node will skip the bytes 8-16, and then process the following bytes following the TLV processing rules, which will cause errors.\r\n2.\tWhen the segment is not removed, Segment Lefts = Last Entry = 0, each segment endpoint will process the TLVs correctly from byte 8+16. \r\n\r\nChoosing option 2 can avoid processing error of SRH TLVs and be compatible with the current hardware implementation. Thus option 1 MUST be avoid in implementation.",
