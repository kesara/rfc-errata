[...]\r\n\r\nThe text should say (filling in the missing 'that'):\r\n\r\n   The User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] also defines the\r\n   concept of a user, defining authentication and privacy protocols and\r\n   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes the SNMP-USER-\r\n|  BASED-SM-MIB module that allows configuration of SNMPv3 user\r\n   credentials to protect SNMPv3 messages.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  clarification in Section 7\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 7, on page 5 of RFC 4545, says:\r\n\r\n|  This MIB module structure is intended to allow the configuration of a\r\n   list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,\r\n|  credentials, and certificates that, when combined, will distinguish\r\n   that identity.\r\n\r\nThe wording should be enhanced, and the reference to certificates\r\nshould be removed -- these apparently have been excluded from the\r\nMIB in the published version.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the text should perhaps better say:\r\n\r\n|  This MIB module's structure is intended to allow the configuration of\r\n   a list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses, and\r\n|  credentials that, when combined, will distinguish that identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  improper DESCRIPTION text\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause for the ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable\r\nOBJECT-TYPE, on page 19, says:\r\n\r\n       DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"A list of address ranges that are allowed to serve\r\n           as the endpoint addresses of a particular identity.\r\n           An address range includes a starting and ending address\r\n|          and an optional netmask, and an address type indicator,\r\n           which can specify whether the address is IPv4, IPv6,\r\n           FC-WWPN, or FC-WWNN.\"\r\n\r\nThis text improperly mentions the use of netmasks, which has been\r\nexplicitely excluded from the MIB module, as can be seen from the\r\nsubsequent IpsAuthIdentAddrAttributesEntry syntax, and as explained\r\nin the last paragraph of Section 7.5, on page 8 of the RFC.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this clause should say:\r\n\r\n       DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"A list of address ranges that are allowed to serve\r\n           as the endpoint addresses of a particular identity.\r\n           An address range includes a starting and ending address,\r\n|          and an address type indicator, which can specify whether\r\n           the address is IPv4, IPv6, FC-WWPN, or FC-WWNN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  redundant MIB objects -- serious danger of inconsistency\r\n\r\nConceptually, rows of the ipsAuthCredChap, ipsAuthCredSrp, and\r\nipsAuthCredKerberos tables are a variant record (union in \"C\")\r\ncontained in the corresponding rows of the ipsAuthCredential table.\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clauses make clear, that the 'life' of the former\r\ntable rows is directly coupled to the 'life' of the latter rows --\r\nfor example, the DESCRIPTION clause of the ipsAuthCredAuthMethod\r\nOBJECT-TYPE says:\r\n\r\n           When a row is created in this table, a corresponding\r\n           row must be created by the management station\r\n           in a corresponding table specified by this value.\r\n\r\n           When a row is deleted from this table, the corresponding\r\n           row must be automatically deleted by the agent in\r\n           the corresponding table specified by this value.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it is inconsistent to have the agent delete the row, but\r\nlet the management station create the row; the SETting of an\r\nipsAuthCredAuthMethod object should create the corresponding row.\r\nAccording to this explanantion and the identical indexing structure\r\nof the four tables, the agent thus is directed to maintain exactly\r\none of those variant rows, matching the current value of a given\r\nipsAuthCredAuthMethod instance.\r\n\r\nIn the published version of the IPS-AUTH-MIB module, the rows\r\nof the basic ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable contains objects of\r\nRowStatus and StorageType syntax that are used to create/activate/\r\ndelete an ipsAuthCredentialAttributesEntry conceptual row, and to\r\nspecify the persistence behaviour of that row, respectively.\r\n\r\nTherefore, IMHO it makes no sense, and it entails the danger of\r\nfundamental semantic inconsistencies in the MIB module, to also\r\nmaintain objects of RowStatus and StorageType syntax in the\r\nvariant table rows.\r\nE.g.,\r\n- no `active` row can exist in the ipsAuthCredChapAttributesTable\r\n  without a corresponding `active` row in the\r\n  ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable;\r\n- no ipsAuthCredChapAttributesEntry can be created by the manager,\r\n  that MUST be done automatically by the agent when the\r\n  ipsAuthCredAuthMethod instance is set to ipsAuthMethodChap;\r\n- the ipsAuthCredentialAttributesEntry should be set inactive,\r\n  if desired, and not the ipsAuthCredChapAttributesEntry;\r\n- the StorageType of both entries MUST be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nTherefore, IMHO the objects\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredChapRowStatus,\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredChapStorageType,\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredSrpRowStatus,\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredSrpStorageType,\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredKerbRowStatus,  and\r\n  o   ipsAuthCredKerbStorageType\r\nshould be deprecated as soon as possible, and its MAX-ACCESS\r\nchanged to read-only, with explanation added to the DESCRIPTION\r\nclauses that the values of these objects (if implemented), are\r\nagent maintained mirrors of the corresponding ipsAuthCredRowStatus\r\nand ipsAuthCredStorageType objects, respectively.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it should be specified that a ipsAuthCredRowStatus\r\ninstance must not be set to `active` unless the proper credentials\r\nhave been set in the appropriate ipsAuthCred* \"detail\" row.\r\n\r\nIf it is decided that automatic row creation by the agent should\r\nnot be specified for backwards compatibility, at least the\r\nipsAuthCred*StorageType objects should be deprecated.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  clarification in compliance statement\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the ipsAuthComplianceV1 MODULE-COMPLIANCE\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n       DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"Initial version of compliance statement based on\r\n           initial version of this MIB module.\r\n\r\n           The Instance and Identity groups are mandatory;\r\n           at least one of the other groups (Name, Address,\r\n|          Credential, Certificate) is also mandatory for\r\n           any given implementation.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar to item (3) above, the reference to 'Certificate' is\r\ninappropriate and should be deleted; additionally, the plural\r\nform of 'Credential' should be used.\r\n\r\nThus, this clause should say:\r\n\r\n       DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"Initial version of compliance statement based on\r\n           initial version of this MIB module.\r\n\r\n           The Instance and Identity groups are mandatory;\r\n           at least one of the other groups (Name, Address,\r\n|          Credentials) is also mandatory for any given\r\n           implementation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  incomplete citations\r\n\r\nThe following References are incomplete according to RFC-Ed policy;\r\nthey should be amended by  \"STD 62, \"  just before the RFC number.\r\n\r\nIn Section 11, on page 40, the entry:\r\n\r\n   [RFC3411]  Harrington, D., Presuhn, R., and B.
