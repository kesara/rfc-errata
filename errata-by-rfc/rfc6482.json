Implementers agree, and as of March 2012, the three public validator implementations already enforce this.\r\n\r\nThis erratum simply states it explicitly, whereas the original text might be misread as leaving room for indirectly-specified resources via \"inherit\".\r\n\r\nThis errata was discussed by the WG, please see SIDR list archive.",
