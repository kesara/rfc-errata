Although RFC 6482 has not yet been marked \"obsolete\", this is only a formality -- draft-ietf-sidrops-rfc6482bis-09 has been approved for publication and is currently in the RFC Editor queue. When editing is complete and rfc6482bis is published as an RFC, 6482 will indeed be obsolete. In that spirit, I'm applying guideline 7 from https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/processing-errata-ietf-stream/ and rejecting this erratum. Note that in the thread referenced above, Job says the erratum is fixed in the bis. If it's not, a new erratum should be raised against the bis.",
