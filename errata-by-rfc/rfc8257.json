    "correct_text": "Instead, a new paragraph for Congestion Response to ECN feedback would be much clearer. First start with RFC 3168's response to ECE and then provide DCTCP's response to ECE.\r\n\r\nI am thinking splitting section 3.3 into two sub-sections - \r\n3.3.1 Computation of DCTCP.Alpha\r\n3.3.2 Congestion Response to ECE at sender\r\n\r\n",
