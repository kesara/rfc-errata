In my interoperability testing it seems that it does but it doesn't seem that this is all that clear from this RFC.\r\n\r\nIt is also unclear from this RFC whether or not SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA should be decrementing from the window size or not. A strict interpretation would suggest it does not since the RFC makes no mention of it.",
