    "notes": "Ports as specified in the original text exceed 16-bit integer space, violating TCP (RFC793 3.1) and UDP (RFC768, \"Format\"). As it stands, this error prevents development of fully-compliant implementations of this protocol.\r\nNote that in this correction I have elected not to round the TCP and UDP ports in sec. 1 and 2 to 31416 - this is to better-preserve the immediate recognizability of the port as the PIgen service.\r\nAlso note that the IP multicast group address specified in sec. 3 exceeds the 32-bit address space specified in RFC 791 sec. 2.3. I have abstained from proposing a correction to this, as I could not think of an IANA-compliant address that still incorporates digits of pi.",
