Furthermore, the clarification of the case insensitive comparison in the following two sentences after that particular sentence use the term MUST.  I suspect some readers of the RFC are reading the word \"should\" and aren't reading the rest of the paragraph.\r\n\r\n---- WK Update ----\r\nThe full quote is: \"According to the original DNS design decision, comparisons on name\r\n   lookup for DNS queries should be case insensitive [STD13]. \", and the title of this (RFC4343) is \"Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity Clarification\" -- seeing as the whole point of this document is to clarify the original spec, I think that readers will read the RFC2119 bits.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do agree that this could be better worded, and future updates of this document should probably reword this to make it clearer.

In other words, if there is a DNS record for ietf.org and I query IETF.org, should the DNS response say ietf.org or IETF.org? I would expect it's the former so that the DNS administrator can inform the DNS requester about the preferred capitalization but I can't figure this out on the basis of the RFC. Does output case preservation refer to something else? All I observe is that tools like dig return the latter when I run 'dig IETF.org'. Maybe an errata is not the right place to ask for clarification but given the name of the RFC, I would expect to find a clear answer to this question in the RFC.\r\n\r\n-- verifier note --\r\nAfter discussion with the RFC author and the errata author, the conclusion is that the RFC isn't wrong but is arguably unclear for some readers.",

Any case insensitivity that internationalized domain names and labels have varies depending on the script and is handled entirely as part of the transformation described in [RFC3454] and [RFC3491], which should be seen for further details.",

It makes selected [UNICODE] characters and code point sequences available through a separate application level transformation from internationalized domain name to DNS domain name and from DNS domain name to internationalized domain name. Because of ambiguities among possible definitions of case and case relationships once one moves beyond ASCII, the IDNA specifications prohibit characters that could be interpreted as \"upper case\", making discussions of case insensitivity irrelevant. See the documents cited for further details.",
    "notes": "In trying to research something else, I reread RFC 4343.  It still references IDNA2003 (RFC 3490ff) as the authority for IDNs and says a few things that are misleading, or worse, under IDNA2008.   In retrospect, RFC 5890 should have updated 4343 and adjusted the language of its Section 5.  The author of 5890 clearly screwed up (i.e., mea culpa) and the WG and broader IETF review, especially by DNS-related groups, did not catch the problem.   \r\n\r\nThe \"corrected\" text above is merely an example of how this might be remedied.  The issue is clearly (at least to me) one to be \"held for document update\" of either RFC 4343 or 5890 but it seems worth inserting a pointer into the errata list to warn those who might want to look for it.",
