Furthermore, the clarification of the case insensitive comparison in the following two sentences after that particular sentence use the term MUST.  I suspect some readers of the RFC are reading the word \"should\" and aren't reading the rest of the paragraph.\r\n\r\n---- WK Update ----\r\nThe full quote is: \"According to the original DNS design decision, comparisons on name\r\n   lookup for DNS queries should be case insensitive [STD13]. \", and the title of this (RFC4343) is \"Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity Clarification\" -- seeing as the whole point of this document is to clarify the original spec, I think that readers will read the RFC2119 bits.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do agree that this could be better worded, and future updates of this document should probably reword this to make it clearer.

In other words, if there is a DNS record for ietf.org and I query IETF.org, should the DNS response say ietf.org or IETF.org? I would expect it's the former so that the DNS administrator can inform the DNS requester about the preferred capitalization but I can't figure this out on the basis of the RFC. Does output case preservation refer to something else? All I observe is that tools like dig return the latter when I run 'dig IETF.org'. Maybe an errata is not the right place to ask for clarification but given the name of the RFC, I would expect to find a clear answer to this question in the RFC.\r\n\r\n-- verifier note --\r\nAfter discussion with the RFC author and the errata author, the conclusion is that the RFC isn't wrong but is arguably unclear for some readers.",
