If the node for which the \"when\" statement is defined is within an rpc, action or notification, the context node also needs to be inside that rpc, action or notification. There are published IETF modules, which rely on this to be true, such as \"ietf-netconf-nmda@2019-01-07\" in RFC8526 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8526) at schema node id \"/ncds:get-data/ncds:input/ncds:origin-filters\". Original text assigns the context node to the root node, if no data node ancestor is found. \"rpc\", \"action\" and \"notification\" are not data nodes and are represented by nodes that are descendants of the root node, as described in Section 6.4.1.",
