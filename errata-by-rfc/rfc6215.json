These definitions are illustrated by showing\r\n   MPLS-TP Provider Edges (PEs) containing a UNI and an NNI.  The\r\n   figures illustrate the UNI and the NNI as a span.  However, it is\r\n   convention to illustrate these interfaces as reference points.\r\n   Furthermore, in the case of a UNI, it is useful to illustrate the\r\n   distribution of UNI functions between the Customer Edge (CE) side and\r\n   the PE side of the UNI, i.e., the UNI-C (User-to-User Interface,\r\n   Client side) and UNI-N (User-to-Network Interface, Network side), in\r\n   order to show their relationship to one another.",
