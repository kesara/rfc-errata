This cannot have been intended.\r\n\r\nWithin Section 4.2.2, the last two paragraphs on page 11 say:\r\n\r\n                                                           vvvvv\r\n   A Domain Identifier is an eight-byte quantity that is a valid BGP\r\n|  Extended Communities attribute, as specified in Section 4.2.4.  If a\r\n   particular OSPF instance has a non-NULL Domain Identifier, when\r\n   routes from that OSPF instance are distributed by BGP as VPN-IPv4\r\n   routes, the routes MUST carry the Domain Identifier Extended\r\n   Communities attribute that corresponds to the OSPF instance's Primary\r\n   Domain Identifier.  If the OSPF instance's Domain Identifier is NULL,\r\n   the Domain Identifier Extended Communities attribute MAY be omitted\r\n   when routes from that OSPF instance are distributed by BGP;\r\n   alternatively, a value of the Domain Identifier Extended Communities\r\n|  attribute that represents NULL (see Section 4.2.4) MAY be carried\r\n   with the route.\r\n                                               ^^^^^\r\n   If the OSPF instances of an OSPF domain are given one or more non-\r\n   NULL Domain Identifiers, this procedure allows us to determine\r\n   whether a particular OSPF-originated VPN-IPv4 route belongs to the\r\n   same domain as a given OSPF instance.  We can then determine whether\r\n   the route should be redistributed to that OSPF instance as an inter-\r\n   area route or as an OSPF AS-external route.  Details can be found in\r\n|  Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.8.1.\r\n            ^^^^^\r\n\r\nI am not sure what really was intended to say.  Perhaps, the\r\nsecond instance of \"4.2.4\" should be replaced by \"4.2.6\".\r\n\r\nPlease check and supply corrected text.\r\n\r\n",
