But when\r\n   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that shares\r\n   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases\r\n   where either a compressor contexts or a decompressor contexts are of\r\n   interest.  ...\"\r\n\r\n  It should say:\r\n\r\n                                                  \"...  But when\r\n   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that shares\r\n   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases\r\n|  where either a compressor context or a decompressor context are of\r\n   interest.  ...\"\r\n\r\n1b)\r\n  Section 4.3.1., near the bottom of page 8, says:\r\n\r\n                 \"...

Every script that\r\n      is stored in non-volatile memory is required to appear in\r\n      this script table.\r\n\r\n      Note ...\"\r\n\r\n  This should be replaced by appropriate text, e.g.,\r\n\r\n|    \"An entry describing a particular ROHC channel.\r\n\r\n      Note ...\"\r\n\r\n  [ Please add whatever you consider appropriate here! ]\r\n\r\n2c)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcChannelFeedbackFor', on page 13,\r\n  seems to me to be not strict enough. Perhaps,\r\n\r\n      \"If no feedback information is transferred on this channel,\r\n       then the value of this ID is 0.  If the channel type is set\r\n       to notInUse(1), then the value of this object must be 0.\r\n       If the channel type is rohc(2) and the value of this object\r\n       is a valid channel ID, then feedback information is\r\n       piggy-backed on the ROHC channel.  If the channel type is\r\n\r\n  should be replaced by:\r\n\r\n      \"If no feedback information is transferred on this channel,\r\n       then the value of this ID is 0.  If the channel type is set\r\n       to notInUse(1), then the value of this object must be 0.\r\n       If the channel type is rohc(2) and the value of this object\r\n|      is non-zero, then feedback information for this channel is\r\n|      piggy-backed and/or interspersed on the same ROHC channel;\r\n|      hence the value of this object must be equal to the value\r\n|      of the indexing rohcChannelID.  If the channel type is\r\n       dedicatedFeedback(3), ...\"\r\n\r\n  [or similar].\r\n\r\n  Rationale:\r\n  As far as I understand RFC 3095 (Section 5.2.2 et al.),\r\n  it is not possible to intersperse or/and piggyback feedback\r\n  information of another channel on a ROHC channel carrying\r\n  payload packets.\r\n\r\n2d)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcInstanceVendor', on page 15,\r\n  contains two issues. Its first sentence contains the word\r\n  \"description\" instead of \"compression\", and the second sentence\r\n  is subject to mis-interpretation due to unfortunate placement of\r\n  the words \"allocated for the vendor\".\r\n  I propose to change the text:\r\n\r\n      \"An object identifier that identifies the vendor who\r\n       provides the implementation of robust header description.\r\n       This object identifier SHALL point to the object identifier\r\n       directly below the enterprise object identifier\r\n       {1 3 6 1 4 1} allocated for the vendor. ...\r\n\r\n  to better read:\r\n\r\n      \"An object identifier that identifies the vendor who\r\n|      provides the implementation of robust header compression.\r\n       This object identifier SHALL point to the object identifier\r\n|      allocated for the vendor directly below the `enterprise'\r\n|      object identifier {1 3 6 1 4 1}. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n2e)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcInstanceContextStorageTime',\r\n  on page 17, says:\r\n\r\n                      ... .  The value of this object is used\r\n     to initialize rohcContexStorageTime object when a new\r\n     context is created.\r\n     Changing ...\r\n\r\n  where it should better say:\r\n\r\n                      ... .  The value of this object is used\r\n|    to initialize the rohcContexStorageTime object when a new\r\n     context is created.\r\n     Changing ...\r\n\r\n2f)\r\n  To better distinguish the counters for payload (i. e. IP) packets\r\n  from the counters IR packets, I recommend to enhance the sentence:\r\n\r\n      \"Counter of all packets passing this instance.\"\r\n\r\n  to read:\r\n\r\n|     \"Counter of all IP packets passing this instance.\"\r\n\r\n  in the DESCRIPTION clauses of following two objects:\r\n\r\n  o   `rohcInstancePackets'       (page 18),\r\n  o   `rohcContextPackets'        (page 25).\r\n\r\n2g)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcProfileVendor', on page 21,\r\n  contains the same two issues as the DESCRIPTION clause for\r\n  `rohcInstanceVendor'. Hence, the modification given above,\r\n  under 2d), should be applied here as well.\r\n\r\n2h)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcProfileNegotiated', on page 21,\r\n  contains a small typo. It says:\r\n\r\n     \"When retrieved, this boolean object returns true\r\n      if the profile has been negotiated to be used at\r\n      the instance, i.e., is supported also be the\r\n      corresponding compressor/decompressor.\"\r\n\r\n  It should say:\r\n\r\n     \"When retrieved, this boolean object returns true\r\n      if the profile has been negotiated to be used at\r\n|     the instance, i.e., is supported also by the\r\n      corresponding compressor/decompressor.\"\r\n\r\n2i)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcContextStorageTime', on page 24,\r\n  contains an improper self-reference. Therefore, replace the text:\r\n\r\n               ... .  This object returns  the remaining time\r\n      that the row may exist before it is aged out.  The object\r\n      is initialized with the value of the  associated\r\n      rohcContextStorageTime object.  After expiration ...\r\n\r\n  by:\r\n\r\n               ... .

The object\r\n      is initialized with the value of the associated\r\n|     rohcInstanceContextStorageTime object.  After expiration ...\r\n\r\n          ^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n2j)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clauses for `ContextAllPacketsMeanSize' and\r\n  `rohcContextAllHeadersMeanSize', on page 28, are concluded with\r\n  the sentence:\r\n\r\n      The mean value is given in byte rounded to the next\r\n      integer value.\"\r\n\r\n  This should be:\r\n\r\n      The mean value is given in bytes rounded to the next\r\n      integer value.\"\r\n\r\n  [ Note: I wished this RFC (and many other MIB RFCs, too) would\r\n    make frequent use of the UNITS clause specified in STD 58 ! ]\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Textual issues in the ROHC-RTP-MIB definition\r\n\r\n3a)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcRtpContextNACKs', on page 42,\r\n  says:\r\n\r\n     \"The number of all dynamic negative feedbacks (ACK) sent\r\n      or received in this context, respectively.\r\n      ...\"\r\n\r\n  It should say:\r\n\r\n|    \"The number of all dynamic negative feedbacks (NACK) sent\r\n      or received in this context, respectively.\r\n      ...\"\r\n\r\n3b)\r\n  The DESCRIPTION clause for `rohcRtpContextSNACKs', on page 42,\r\n  says:\r\n\r\n     \"The number of all static negative feedbacks (ACK) sent\r\n      or received in this context, respectively.\r\n      ...\"\r\n\r\n  It should say:\r\n\r\n|    \"The number of all static negative feedbacks (STATIC-NACK)\r\n|     sent or received in this context, respectively.\r\n      ...\"",
