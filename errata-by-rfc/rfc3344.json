It is not applicable for extensions which require more\r\n   than 256 bytes of data; for such extensions, use the format described\r\n   in section 1.10.\"\r\n\r\nHowever 1.10 specifies that it is applicable to only non-skippable extensions, so what would be the format for skippable extensions of size more than 256 bytes?\r\n\r\nThe correction will specify that any extension (skippable or non-skippable) shall use long format if its length is more than 256 bytes.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nPete McCann, chair of MIP4 held a discussion about this in the WG and the conclusion was that the errata should be rejected.",
