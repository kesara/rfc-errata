    "notes": "The field described in the paragraph belongs to a public key. The way I understand it, particularly due to the inclusion of a digest, \"RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 with SHA-256\" (sha256WithRSAEncryption) is not really a public key algorithm identifier; it's a signature algorithm identifier.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of Russ Housley) rsaEncryption also allows the public key to be used with PKCS#1 v1.5, RSASSA-PSS, and RSAES-OAEP.\r\n\r\nAll existing RPKI readers and writers that I've seen, as well as the global RPKI repository certificates themselves, currently use rsaEncryption as the public key algorithm of subjectPublicKeyInfo. Therefore, this change should also reflect existing practice.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nAny changes to normative statements require WG consensus.  In this case, rfc7935 has been updated twice.  Discussion should happen in the sidrops WG.",
