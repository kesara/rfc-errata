The \r\nregistration record can also be a \r\nvaluable aid for determining the term of \r\ncopyright protection, by providing \r\ninformation such as the author’s date of \r\ndeath, the publication date for the work, \r\nor the year of creation of the work. \r\nA separate provision of the Act \r\nrequires the Register of Copyrights to \r\n‘‘compile and publish . . . catalogs of \r\nall copyright registrations.’’ 17 U.S.C. \r\n707(a). For most of the Office’s history, \r\nthis catalog was maintained in paper \r\nform as the Catalog of Copyright Entries \r\n(‘‘CCE’’). Starting in 1994, however, the \r\nOffice began providing the public with \r\naccess to a computerized database of \r\npost-1977 copyright registration and \r\nrecordation catalog entries via the \r\ninternet. Then, in 1996, the Office \r\ndecided to end publication of the \r\nprinted CCE and publish copyright \r\nregistration information solely via an \r\nonline public catalog. See 61 FR 52465 \r\n(Oct. 7, 1996). \r\nInitially, the PII revealed in the online \r\npublic catalog was limited to names \r\nand, when volunteered, the author’s \r\nyear of birth. By 2007, however, with \r\nthe advent of the Copyright Office’s \r\nonline registration system (‘‘eCO’’), a \r\nbroader range of PII was pushed from \r\nthe Office’s registration records into the \r\nonline public catalog, including the \r\npostal address of the claimants, and the \r\nname, postal address, email address and \r\nphone number of the person authorized \r\nto correspond about, and/or provide \r\nrights and permission to use, the \r\nregistered work. See 72 FR 36883, 36887 \r\n(July 6, 2007). The current online public \r\ncatalog, however, does not contain all of \r\nthe information that is contained in the \r\nOffice’s full registration records. For \r\ninstance, the online public catalog \r\ncurrently does not include the text of \r\ncorrespondence between the Office and \r\nthe applicant. This information is \r\nmaintained solely in the Office’s offline \r\nrecords, although members of the public \r\ncan obtain copies of it by making a \r\nrequest to the Office. \r\nIn addition, while the information in \r\nthe online public catalog initially could \r\nonly be searched and retrieved via the \r\nOffice’s Web site, in 2007 third parties \r\nbegan harvesting registration \r\ninformation, including PII, from the \r\ncatalog, and posting that information on \r\nalternative Web sites, which were then \r\nindexed by search engines. As a result, \r\nauthors and claimants began noticing \r\ntheir personal information appearing in \r\ninternet search results, and began asking \r\nthe Office to remove that information \r\nfrom the Office’s online public catalog. \r\nIn 2008, the Office published a list of \r\nfrequently asked questions (‘‘FAQs’’) on \r\nprivacy to address some of these \r\nconcerns.3 In the FAQs, the Office \r\nstressed that, by statute, it was required \r\nto collect certain information as part of \r\nthe registration application and \r\nmaintain it as part of its public records. \r\nThe FAQs advised the public that if \r\nthey did not wish sensitive personal \r\ninformation to appear in the online \r\npublic catalog, they should refrain from \r\nproviding it during the registration \r\nprocess, if possible. Applicants were \r\nadvised to instead consider providing \r\nnon-personal information, such as \r\ninformation about a third-party agent, a \r\npost office box, or a non-personal email \r\naddress. But the Office warned that, if \r\nthe applicant provided personal \r\ninformation, it would be included in the \r\nonline public catalog. Both the Web \r\npage to log in to the online registration \r\nsystem and the Web page to download \r\npaper application forms include links to \r\nthe privacy FAQs.
