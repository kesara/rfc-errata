It looks to me as though this happened between kerberos-clarifications-04 and -05.  If I had to guess, it was probably trying to say that you can roll your own private-use prefixes (beginning with \"X-\" or \"x-\"), but any other prefixes must go through the official registry process, per RFC 6111?\r\n\r\nPaul Wouters (AD): the -04 draft said: All prefixes must be assigned before they may be used. The -05 version is as in the RFC. It seems indeed that an exception was contemplated for specific prefixes starting with x- or X-. This can be read in The IANA Considerations section.",
