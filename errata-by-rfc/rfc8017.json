Confirmed.\r\n\r\nBackground:  The addition of SHA224 support to PKCS #1 required a few minor technical updates in PKCS #1 v2.2 compared to v2.1, and to the corresponding RFC8017 compared to RFC3447.  PKCS #1 v2.2 got the correct update, but RFC8017 didn't -- presumably a copy-and-paste error.  My oversight in reviewing the edits.  Thanks, Joost, for pointing it out.",
