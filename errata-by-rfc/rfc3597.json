One HINFO too much is no issue,\r\nbut if this actually should be TXT it's a real typo.\r\n\r\nneither TXT nor HINFO contain domain names in RDATA, so it's a bug in both\r\nRFC 3597 and 4034, although one that doesn't hurt. One could also argue that the list lacks NSAP-PTR, but then that's as obsolete as MD ans MF.",
