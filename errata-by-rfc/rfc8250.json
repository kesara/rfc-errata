    "notes": "The term monotonically increasing just means that the value must not decrease; it does not mean that it must increase. For example a monotonically increasing sequence may be: 1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. On the other hand, a sequentially increasing example would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. I believe that the authors intended for the value to increase sequentially for each packet.",
