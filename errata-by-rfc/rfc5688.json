Amongst those capabilities are the\r\n|  type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME\r\n|  types.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range\r\n   of stream types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a\r\n   capability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which\r\n   application subtypes the agent supports.\r\n\r\nc)  Section 3, 1st para\r\n\r\n   The 'sip.app-subtype' media feature tag is of type token with a case-\r\n   insensitive equality relationship.  Its value can be any registered\r\n|  or private MIME application subtype compliant to the subtype-name\r\n   grammar defined in [RFC4288].

It says nothing about the functionality provided by the\r\n|  user agent itself or the MIME types that the agent can send or\r\n   receive in SIP messages or emails.  For example, let us assume that a\r\n   SIP user agent is capable of supporting a chess game.  The game is\r\n   played by each user sending chess moves as binary objects over UDP\r\n|  between a pair of user agents.  Those objects have a MIME type of\r\n   \"application/example\".
