Hence, re-parenting\r\nof registrations should be explicitely mentioned there, in\r\norder to avoid registries to become outdated/incomplete\r\nover time, as has happened repeatedly in the past.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in this case IANA has operated intelligently\r\nand updated the Ref. in the registry without being requested\r\nexplicitely.  Thanks to IANA!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I suggest to document this issue in an Errata Note\r\nin order to remind future authors of the possible drawbacks of\r\nnot including update instructions for already existing registrations\r\nin their IANA Considerations.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   This errata provided no additional information needed by an implementer of RFC5301.",
