In implicit bootstrapping, the local ER server SHOULD\r\n   include its domain name and SHOULD request the DSRK from the home AAA\r\n   server during the initial EAP exchange, in the AAA message\r\n   encapsulating the first EAP Response message sent by the peer.",

In implicit bootstrapping, the local AAA client or agent \r\n   SHOULD include its domain name and SHOULD request the DSRK from the home AAA\r\n   server in the AAA message encapsulating the first EAP Response message sent\r\n   by the peer during the initial EAP exchange.",
    "notes": "The local ER server is an ERP entity, incapable of inserting anything into a AAA message; the ER server's purpose is to provide reauthentication services, not to edit AAA messages.  Furthermore, the original text requires that the ER server unnecessarily insert itself in the path of EAP messages, slowing the initial authentication.",

    "notes": "The original text makes two unwarranted assumptions, which the corrected text eliminates.  The first assumption is that the EAP server in the home domain is located on a back-end authentication (i.e., AAA) server; the second that the home ERP server is also located there.  Neither of these conditions are required and place unnecessary restrictions upon deployment options.",
