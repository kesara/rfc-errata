    "notes": "Section 3.5 comments about MplsLsrIdentifier.\r\nIt says that RFC 3811 \"lack[s] support for IPv6 in defining MplsExtendedTunnelId and MplsLsrIdentifier.\" It also says that \"[MPLS-TC] tries to resolve this gap by marking this textual convention as obsolete.\"\r\n\r\nNote that the second quote refers to just one TC.\r\n\r\nLooking at 3811, 5036, and (most importantly) 7552, it seems to me that the LSR Identifier is *always* a 32 bit quantity regardless of whether the LDP system is v4-only, v4/v6, or v6-only. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, draft-manral-mpls-rfc3811bis (i.e., [MPLS-TC]) clearly shows no\r\nchange to MplsLsrIdentifier while marking MplsExtendedTunnelId as obsolete.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that draft-manral-mpls-rfc3811bis appears to have been abandoned in state \"candidate for WG adoption\", it looks to me that RFC 7439 has an error we could call a typo.",
