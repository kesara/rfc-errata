Section 19.6 of RFC 2616.\r\nThus, there is no more current specification for these elements.\r\nAccording to my understanding that means that these elements\r\neffectively have been deprecated by RFC 2616.\r\n\r\nAmong those (deprecated) elements of HTTP 1.1 are the HTTP Header\r\nFields:\r\n         -  Content-Base\r\n         -  Content-Version\r\n         -  Derived-From\r\n         -  Keep-Alive\r\n         -  Link\r\n         -  Public\r\n         -  URI\r\n\r\nAs expected, the Registrations for these HTTP Header Fields, as\r\npresented in RFC 4229, consistently all refer to RFC 2068 [4] as\r\nthe (obsolete) 'Specification document' -- but, very surprisingly,\r\nthe registered 'Status' entries for these Header Fields all contain:\r\n\"standard\" instead of \"deprecated\".\r\n\r\nAccording to my understanding of IETF procedures, a feature or\r\nprotocol element must not be named \"standard\" if its specification\r\nhas been officially obsoleted / deprecated by a Standards Track RFC.\r\n\r\nHence, IMHO the IANA Registrations for the above mentioned HTTP\r\nHeader Fields (Subsections 2.1.{21,33,41,59,62,89,108} of RFC 4229\r\nshould be immediately corrected to contain 'Status: deprecated\".\r\n",
