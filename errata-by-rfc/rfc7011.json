    "notes": "If the size of data record corresponding to a template can ever be zero, then  the only valid size for such a data set is the size of the set header.  For normal cases any size greater than that of the set header is a valid size, since records are read from a set until the number of octets remaining is less than the smallest possible record size for that set.  If a record size can be zero, then any number of bytes past the header cannot be padding (is not smaller than the smallest record), and a conforming implementation might return an infinite number of zero-sized records.  As this could cause a denial of service situation, rejecting templates that define zero-sized records seems to be the simplest solution.\r\n\r\nSimilar text may be necessary for Option Template records, though the fact that the scope count MUST be non-zero may negate the necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWK: See thread https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipfix/AkCZr1jObLt_x9cyQ73qXBlKC2w/ for more info.\r\nWK -  2023-04-26: Update from the original reporter (Michael) and confirmations from authors (Brian and Benoit) that Field Count can be zero in the case of Template Withdrawal.
