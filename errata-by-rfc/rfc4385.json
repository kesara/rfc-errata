    "correct_text": "The sequence number mechanism for all PW types except the TDM PWs \r\nSAToP [RFC4553], CESoPSN [RFC5086], and TDMoIP [RFC5087] use a \r\ncircular unsigned 16-bit number space that excludes the value zero. \r\nThe sequence numbers for TDM PWs include the value zero.\r\n...\r\no For all non-TDM PWs the sequence number that follows 65535 \r\n(maximum unsigned 16-bit number) is one.\r\n...\r\no If the sequence number on a non-TDM-PW packet is zero, the sequence\r\n  integrity of the packets cannot be determined.

    "notes": "The fact that the TDM PWs always require sequence number and do not give a zero value special meaning was well-known and documented in the relevant RFCs. However, this was forgotten in this document and has caused confusion to implementers.",
