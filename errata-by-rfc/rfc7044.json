For example, if\r\n       the index of the last hi-entry in the request received was 1.1.2\r\n       and there was a missing hi-entry and the request was being\r\n       forwarded to the next hop, the resulting index will be 1.1.2.0.1.\r\n\t   \r\n\t   But as per 9.1 stated above, once an entity receive a request with missing history info\r\n\t\tit has to add an entry to cache on behalf of previous one.\r\n\t\tSo referring the previous example the added index would be 1.1.2.1\r\n\t\tAnd by applying the rule in 10.3, the index for the new request created by this entity would be 1.1.2.1.0.1 not 1.1.2.0.1",
