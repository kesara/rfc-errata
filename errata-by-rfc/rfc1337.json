    "notes": "I see two problems here.\r\n\r\nFirst, line 6 is the arrival of segment sent at line 3, so it should have the same advertised window.\r\n\r\nSecond, in the following paragraph it is said that B's receive window is [101,900), which is consistent neither with line 3 (W=800) nor line 6 (W=900).\r\n\r\nI guess (that's just a guess) the author meant W=800 in both lines 3 and 6, and made an off-by-one error in B receive's window.  If it starts at 101 and has 800 for size, it is [101,901)",
