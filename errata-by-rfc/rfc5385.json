Those webpages are no more. There is a redirect to Joe's personal website at www.strayalpha.com as a hint and the current correct reference for the tools being maintained is presumably\r\nhttps://www.strayalpha.com/tools/ but who knows how long that redirect will exist and how long those personal webpages will be there? An expired credit card could kill the domain and the resource.\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20171121144145/https://www.isi.edu/touch/tools/\r\nhas a copy of the original page referenced.\r\n\r\nA copy of the template and tools probably needs to be hosted on an IETF-controlled server, with this erratum pointing at that IETF copy as canonical.\r\n\r\n(Also, don' t add periods after urls to preserve grammar -just confuses everyone.)",
