    "correct_text": "The Opus codec scales from 6 kbit/s narrowband mono speech to\r\n510 kbit/s fullband stereo music, with algorithmic delays ranging\r\nfrom 5 ms to 66.5 ms.\r\n\r\n(further in the same section)\r\n\r\nTo\r\ncompensate for the different look-ahead required by each layer, the\r\nCELT encoder input is delayed by an additional 4 ms.",
    "notes": "For the latter text, the delays for the CELT and SILK layers must match.  SILK has a \"5 ms look-ahead for noise shaping estimation\", and \"1.5 ms delay for sampling rate conversion\", totaling 6.5 ms.  CELT has a \"2.5 ms look-ahead due to the overlapping MDCT windows\".  Thus, the amount of delay needed to align CELT with SILK is 6.5ms - 2.5ms = 4ms.\r\n\r\nThe text at the beginning of the section must reflect this as well.  The \"algorithmic delays\" reported apparently include framing (minimum frame size 2.5ms + look-ahead delay in CELT-only mode 2.5ms = 5ms).  In that case, the maximum delay is the maximum frame size (60ms) + the maximum delay for look-ahead and resampling (6.5ms) = 66.5ms.\r\n\r\nConfirmed by author (\"Jmvalin\") at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opus_(audio_format)/Archive_1#Codec_delay_values",
