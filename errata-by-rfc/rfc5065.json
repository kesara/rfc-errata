    "orig_text": "(1)  obsolete reference tag - #1\r\n\r\nApparently, some reference tags have not been updated when the\r\n'References' Section (10.) has been modified to incorporate\r\ncurrent versions of the relevant documents.\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of Section 1, on page 3 of RFC 5065, says:\r\n\r\n   This scaling problem has been well documented and a number of\r\n|  proposals have been made to alleviate this, such as [RFC2796] and\r\n   [RFC1863] (made historic by [RFC4223]).  [...]\r\n\r\nRFC 2796 has been obsoleted by RFC 4456, and Section 10.2 only\r\ncontains an entry for [RFC4456], which is only used in the\r\nsecond paragraph of Section 2, but no entry for [RFC 2796].\r\n\r\nTherefore, the above sentence should better say:\r\n\r\n   This scaling problem has been well documented and a number of\r\n|  proposals have been made to alleviate this, such as [RFC4456] and\r\n   [RFC1863] (made historic by [RFC4223]).  [...]\r\n\r\nor, if you prefer, for the sake of historical precision:\r\n\r\n   This scaling problem has been well documented and a number of\r\n|  proposals have been made to alleviate this, such as [RFC4456]\r\n|  (first version published in [RFC 2796]) and [RFC1863] (made historic\r\n   by [RFC4223]).  [...]\r\n\r\nFor the latter variant, an entry for [RFC2796] must be restored into\r\nSection 10.2, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  sluggish / imprecise language\r\n\r\nThe third paragraph of Section 4, at the bottom of page 5, says:\r\n\r\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing an autonomous\r\n|  system matching its own AS Confederation Identifier SHALL treat the\r\n   path in the same fashion as if it had received a path containing its\r\n   own AS number.\r\n\r\nPreferably, the text should not mess up the terms 'autonomous system'\r\nand 'autonomous system number'.\r\nThus, it should say:\r\n\r\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing an autonomous\r\n|  system number matching its own AS Confederation Identifier SHALL\r\n   treat the path in the same fashion as if it had received a path\r\n   containing its own AS number.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  misleading specification, with bad wording\r\n\r\nIn Section 4.1, the bullets b) 1) (on page 6) and c) 2) (on page 7)\r\nhave been amended by instructions for the case of AS_PATH segment\r\noverflow.  Although the details of the action necessary according\r\nto the spirit of BGP differ in a small, but important way, the\r\nsame wording is used in both cases.  That might be very misleading.\r\nI propose to explicitely specify the AS number to be inserted in\r\nboth cases, using the terms defined in Section 1.2.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the word 'prepend' is abused in the last part of the\r\namendments and might even be misleading.\r\nI propose to use 'include' in there, as the text already does in\r\nsimilar context, for instance in the immediately subsequent bullets.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the text in bullet b) 1) (on page 6),\r\n\r\n                     [...].  If the act of prepending will cause an\r\n         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASs), it\r\n         SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and\r\n|        prepend its own AS number to this new segment.\r\n         ^^^^^^^         ^^^^^^^^^ ^^\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n                     [...].  If the act of prepending will cause an\r\n         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASs), it\r\n         SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and\r\n|        include its own Member-AS number in this new segment.\r\n         ^^^^^^^         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the identical text in bullet c) 2) (on page 7),\r\n\r\n                     [...].  If the act of prepending will cause an\r\n         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASs), it\r\n|        SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and prepend\r\n|        its own AS number to this new segment.\r\n                 ^^^^^^^^^ ^^                                 ^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n                     [...].  If the act of prepending will cause an\r\n         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASs), it\r\n|        SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and include\r\n|        its own AS Condeferation Identifier in this new segment.\r\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^               ^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n(4)  textual enhancement\r\n\r\nStill in Section 4.1, in the lower half of pgae 7, the bullets a) and\r\nb) under headline:\r\n\r\n   When a BGP speaker originates a route then:\r\n\r\ndeal with similar cases using (almost) similar wording.\r\nBullet b) says:\r\n\r\n   b) the originating speaker includes its own Member-AS Number in a\r\n      path segment, of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, in the AS_PATH attribute\r\n      of all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring\r\n|     Member Autonomous Systems that are members of the local\r\n      confederation.  [...]\r\n\r\nTo finalize the similarity, and to remove the unnecessary repetition\r\nof the word 'member', it would perhaps have been better to say:\r\n\r\n   b) the originating speaker includes its own Member-AS Number in a\r\n      path segment, of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, in the AS_PATH attribute\r\n      of all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring\r\n|     autonomous systems that are members of the local confederation.\r\n      [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  typo, and unnecessarily differing case\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph of the new Section 5 says:\r\n\r\n         vv\r\n|  It is a error for a BGP speaker to receive an update message from a\r\n   confederation peer that is not in the same Member-AS that does not\r\n   have AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE as the first segment.  [...]\r\n\r\nTo correct the grammar, and to harmonize the case of 'UPDATE message'\r\nthroughout the whole section, it should say:\r\n\r\n         vvv\r\n|  It is an error for a BGP speaker to receive an UPDATE message from a\r\n   confederation peer that is not in the same Member-AS that does not\r\n   have AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE as the first segment.  [...]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, perhaps, the obstinate double 'that' could easily be\r\nremoved as well:\r\n\r\n         vvv\r\n|  It is an error for a BGP speaker to receive an UPDATE message from a\r\n|  confederation peer not located in the same Member-AS that does not\r\n   have AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE as the first segment.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  grammar\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 6, on top of page 10, says:\r\n\r\n                                             vv\r\n|  All BGP speakers participating as members of a confederation MUST\r\n   recognize the AS_CONFED_SET and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment type\r\n   extensions to the AS_PATH attribute.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it should be  ... participating *in* ...\r\nThus, the RFC should say:\r\n                                             vv\r\n|  All BGP speakers participating as members in a confederation MUST\r\n   recognize the AS_CONFED_SET and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment type\r\n   extensions to the AS_PATH attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  obsolete reference tag - #2\r\n\r\nSection 8 (at the bottom of page 10) says:\r\n\r\n   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues\r\n   inherent in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in\r\n|  [RFC2385] and [BGP-VULN].\r\n                  ^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nThere is no such reference tag '[BGP-VULN]' in Section 10.\r\nApparently, the RFC should say:\r\n\r\n   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues\r\n   inherent in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in\r\n|  [RFC2385] and [RFC4272].\r\n                  ^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)  obsolete reference tag - #3\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 9, on top of page 11, says:\r\n\r\n   The general concept of BGP confederations was taken from IDRP's\r\n   Routing Domain Confederations [ISO10747].  Some of the introductory\r\n|  text in this document was taken from [RFC2796].\r\n                                            ^^^^\r\n\r\nAs in item (1) above, either the tag '[RFC2796]' is updated:\r\n\r\n   The general concept of BGP confederations was taken from IDRP's\r\n   Routing Domain Confederations [ISO10747].
