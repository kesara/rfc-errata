    "orig_text": "(2)  issue: non-use of appropriate TC (?)\r\n\r\nThe isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE macro instance, on page 36,\r\ncontains the SYNTAX clause:\r\n\r\n    isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE\r\n        SYNTAX Unsigned32(0..255)\r\n\r\nAfter comparison with similar context in the RFC, I suspect that it\r\nwould be appropriate to use the IsisUnsigned8TC TEXTUAL-CONVENTION\r\nin this place as well:\r\n\r\n    isisCircLevelIDOctet OBJECT-TYPE\r\n|       SYNTAX IsisUnsigned8TC\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  issue: unexpected indexing\r\n\r\nAs described in the SMIv2 RFCs, RFC 4444 extends various tables\r\nby \"reusing\" of common index objects.  Surprisingly, there are\r\ntwo deviations from this practice I cannot detect any reason for:\r\n\r\n(3.1)\r\nThe isisSystemCounterTable (page 39 ff.) is indexed by the fresh,\r\nindependant index object, \"isisSysStatLevel\", while IMHO it would\r\nhave been logical to use the already defined index object of the\r\nisisSysLevelTable (page 25 ff.), \"isisSysLevelIndex\", for this\r\npurpose as well.\r\n\r\n(3.2)\r\nThe isisPacketCounterTable (page 46 ff.) is indexed in the 2nd place\r\nby the fresh, independant index object, \"isisPacketCountLevel\",\r\nwhile IMHO it would have been logical to use the full index structure\r\nof the isisCircLevelTable (page 34 ff.), including the index object,\r\n\"isisCircLevelIndex\" in the second place, for this purpose as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  issue: many unusual UNITS clauses\r\n\r\nThe UNITS clause is intended a to contains a textual definition of\r\nthe units associated with the object (according to RFC 2578, Section\r\n7.2).  Network management systems usually provide for narrow label\r\nspace in their display screens - expecting usual [physical] unit\r\nnames like \"bytes\", \"kilobytes\", \"seconds\", \"centiseconds\", \"Mbps\",\r\n\"packets\", \"frames\", \"cells\", \"percent\", etc.\r\n\r\nFor most packet counters, RFC 4444 specifies very unusual, lengthy\r\ntexts in the UNITS clauses that duplicate the text given in the\r\nrespective DESCRIPTION clauses.\r\nThis style should better have been avoided and might be noted as\r\nan issue for any potential future update to RFC 4444.\r\n\r\nFor example, the isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE declaration, on\r\npage 49 :\r\n\r\n    isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE\r\n        SYNTAX Counter32\r\n|       UNITS \"Number of IS-IS CSNP frames seen in this direction at\r\n|            this level\"\r\n        MAX-ACCESS read-only\r\n        STATUS current\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n            \"The number of IS-IS CSNPs seen in this\r\n             direction at this level.\"\r\n        REFERENCE \"{ISIS.aoi iSISControlPDUsSent (43)}\"\r\n    ::= { isisPacketCounterEntry 7 }\r\n\r\nshould perhaps better say:\r\n\r\n    isisPacketCountCSNP OBJECT-TYPE\r\n        SYNTAX Counter32\r\n|       UNITS \"frames\"\r\n        MAX-ACCESS read-only\r\n        STATUS current\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n            \"The number of IS-IS CSNPs seen in this\r\n             direction at this level.\"\r\n        REFERENCE \"{ISIS.aoi iSISControlPDUsSent (43)}\"\r\n    ::= { isisPacketCounterEntry 7 }\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  errata(?): overly restrictive RowStatus object descriptions\r\n\r\nSome tables with conceptual rows that can be dynamically added\r\nor deleted, contain a control object with SYNTAX RowStatus\r\nand other control objects, e.g. with SYNTAX IsisAdminState.\r\n\r\nI expect that the latter objects have been intended to control\r\nthe activity of \"live\" table rows, without the need to deactivate\r\nthese rows via the RowStatus object before setting the AdminState\r\nto \"on\" or \"off\", so much the more the support for the\r\n'notInServcie' state of the RowStatus objects is explicitely\r\n\"not required\".  Therefore, I strongly suspect that some RowStatus\r\nobject DESCRIPTION clauses have unintentionally been worded overly\r\nrestrictive and should been corrected to allow AdminStatus changes.\r\n\r\nSome other such clauses contain statements that are void due to the\r\nlack of accessible objects in those tables they could be applied to.\r\n\r\nI have identified the following instances of these issues:\r\n\r\n(5.3)\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the isisCircExistState OBJECT-TYPE macro\r\ninstance, on page 31, says:\r\n\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n            \"The existence state of this circuit.  Setting the state\r\n             to 'notInService' halts the generation and processing of\r\n             IS-IS protocol PDUs on this circuit.  Setting the state\r\n             to destroy will also erase any configuration associated\r\n             with the circuit.  Support for 'createAndWait' and\r\n             'notInService' is not required.\r\n\r\n|            A row entry cannot be modified when the value of this\r\n|            object is 'active'.\"\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps instead say:\r\n\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n            \"The existence state of this circuit.

Repeatedly, the\r\nnumber of objects could have been reduced by including properly\r\nindexed objects into the notifications object groups instead of\r\nseparate \"special\" objects.  But this might have been considered\r\nacceptable for the sake of a consistent object grouping style.\r\n\r\nBut there is one redundancy that could easily have been avoided.\r\nThe isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE declaration, on page 74,\r\n\r\n    isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE\r\n        OBJECTS {\r\n            isisNotificationSysLevelIndex,\r\n            isisSysLevelState\r\n        }\r\n\r\nincludes the object, \"isisSysLevelState\", that already carries\r\nthe required SysLevelIndex in the index part of its OID, because\r\nit is contained in the isisSysLevelTable.\r\nTherefore, without any loss of information for the receiver of the\r\nnotification, this declaration could have been simplified to specify:\r\n\r\n    isisDatabaseOverload NOTIFICATION-TYPE\r\n        OBJECTS {\r\n            isisSysLevelState\r\n        }",
