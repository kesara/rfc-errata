    "orig_text": "The same solution should work for NFS.  However, the NFSv4 protocol\r\n   does not currently give the client a way to transmit the umask of the\r\n   process opening a file.  And clients have no way of atomically\r\n   checking for inheritable permissions and applying the umask only when\r\n   necessary.  As a result, the server receives an OPEN with a mode\r\n   attribute that already has the umask applied.",
    "correct_text": "Implementing a comparable solution for NFS is not currently possible.\r\nIt cannot be implemented in the server as the server does not know\r\nthe umask, and the protocol does not allow the client to tell it.\r\nIt cannot be implemented in the client as the client cannot atomically\r\ncheck the inheritable permissions on the containing directory and\r\napply the umask selectively. As a result, the server receives an\r\nOPEN with a mode attribute that already has the umask applied.",
    "notes": "The intent of the paragraph is obscured by clumsy language.  It is explaining how neither the server\r\nnor the client can currently make the required decision, but this is not immediately obvious.",
