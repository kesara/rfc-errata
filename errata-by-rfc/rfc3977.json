    "notes": "RFC 3977 is unclear about the 421 and 422 response codes:  the first article of a newsgroup is defined as its reported low water mark, and the last article as its reported high water mark (see Section 6.1.1.2).  However, there MAY be no previous article in the group, although the current article number is not the reported low water mark (see the second paragraph of Section 6.1.3.2).  Therefore, a 422 response code MUST also be returned in that case.  A similar case for the next article and the 421 response code exists.\r\n\r\nThe notion of \"previous\" and \"next\" article is respectively defined in the first paragraph of Sections 6.1.3.2 and 6.1.4.2.\r\n\r\nThis erratum also reverses the order of 412, 420, and 421/422 so that it is clearer that an invalid newsgroup or article number takes precedence in determining the return code.",

That's why the 423 response code needs to be sent when the current article number is valid but does not exist.\r\n\r\nNote that this erratum also takes into account the previously reported erratum 1524.\r\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \r\n   Section 6.2.1.2 paragraph 6 says \"a previously valid article number\r\nMAY become invalid if the article has been removed\". Therefore the correct\r\nresponse in the situation being addressed would be 420, not 423.\r\n\r\nThis could be a case that might be considered if the document is updated, but certainly it's not a simple error in the document.",
