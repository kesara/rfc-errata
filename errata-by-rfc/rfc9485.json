    "notes": "`\\S` excludes the form feed and vertical tabulation characters in Perl, ECMAScript, and other implementations, while the suggested replacement includes them. Given the entire document is about interoperable regular expressions, misrepresentation of the common definition of `\\S` runs counter to that. Including form feed and vertical tabulation literally in the replacement expression is not likely to be helpful, so removing the misleading rows seems to be the best option.",
