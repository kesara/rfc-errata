However the Security Warning in the same section states that\r\n\r\n      ... this specification allows entities other than the user's server to\r\n      maintain roster information, which means that a roster push might\r\n      include a 'from' address other than the bare JID of the user's\r\n      account.  Therefore, the client MUST check the 'from' address to\r\n      verify that the sender of the roster push is authorized to update\r\n      the roster.\r\n\r\nwhich contradicts what is specified in ยง 2.1.6 2.\r\n\r\nVerifier note: This seems more than editorial, and probably needs some discussion about third party authorizations.
