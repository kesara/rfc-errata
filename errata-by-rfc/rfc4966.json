    "orig_text": "Unless UDP encapsulation is used for IPsec [RFC3498], traffic using\r\nIPsec AH (Authentication Header), in transport and tunnel mode, and\r\nIPsec ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), in transport mode, is\r\nunable to be carried through NAT-PT without terminating the security\r\nassociations on the NAT-PT, due to their usage of cryptographic\r\nintegrity protection.",
    "correct_text": "IPsec traffic using AH (Authentication Header) [RFC4302] in both\r\ntransport and tunnel modes cannot be carried through NAT-PT without\r\nterminating the security associations on the NAT-PT, due to the\r\ninclusion of IP header fields in the scope of AH's cryptographic\r\nintegrity protection [RFC3715].  In addition, IPsec traffic using\r\nESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) [RFC4303] in transport mode\r\ngenerally uses UDP encapsulation [RFC3948] for NAT traversal\r\n(including NAT-PT traversal) in order to avoid the problems\r\ndescribed in [RFC3715].\r\n",
