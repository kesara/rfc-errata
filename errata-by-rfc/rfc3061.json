    "notes": "This suggested change is not substantive and makes no change to the spec itself.  Instead, it supplies some additional, up-to-date, information that might be helpful to the reader and is intended to act as a placeholder to record that information for any future revision or update to 3061.\r\n\r\nNote to RFC Editor: the source for this document is listed as \"legacy\", perhaps because it was published as Informational.  However, it is the definition source for a Formal URN Namespace and those namespaces require IETF consensus action (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml), so the erratum should probably be processed as if it were a standards-track document.",
