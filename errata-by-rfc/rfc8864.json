    "correct_text": "[RFC8831] does not restrict the SCTP Stream identifiers for data\r\nchannels negotiated out-of-band. The endpoints are free to assign\r\nany numbers to the negotiated data channels; collisions are handled\r\nby the usual mechanisms used to avoid SDP signalling glare.\r\n\r\n",
    "notes": "The procedures of [RFC8832] are inappropriate in this case, because DCMAP indicates channels negotiated out-of-band and not via DCEP.\r\n\r\nAt initial offer, the DTLS direction attribute is ACTPASS, so the direction is not known. Thus, the RFC 8832 numbering rule is impossible to apply anyway.",
