In particular, the entire ATM control word (the 3rd word\r\nin Figure 4) is optional, and *not* the various bit fields therein.\r\nTo properly reflect these requirements, the RFC should says instead:\r\n\r\n|  As shown above, in Figure 4, the optional ATM Control Word (if\r\n|  present) is inserted before the ATM service payload.

See Section 5.1.2 of this RFC, RFC 4385,\r\nand the recently published RFC 4928 for additional explanation!\r\n\r\n(a.3)\r\nThe 'Sequence Number' field is *not* optional in the control word,\r\nas erroneously might be deduced from the original version of the\r\nfigure; it MUST always be present; according to Section 5.1.2, only\r\nthe *processing* of this field is optional, and the reserved value 0\r\nis *not* a valid sequence number; it indicates non-use of sequence\r\nnumber processing.  Hence, the lower half of the ATM Control Word\r\neither contains a sequence number or 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n(10c)  incomplete specification\r\n\r\nThe description of the fields in Figure 11 is incomplete.\r\nAs a service to the reader, for completeness the following\r\ntext should be added at the end of Section 10.1:\r\n\r\n|  For a description of the Length and Sequence Number fields, see\r\n|  Section 5.1.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n(11)  Section 11.1 -- surprising/confusing specification details\r\n\r\n(11b)  lack of precision\r\n\r\nBelow Figure 12, the RFC text on page 29 says:\r\n\r\n   The M, V, Res, and C bits are as defined earlier for VCC One-to-one\r\n   cell mode.\r\n\r\nFor clarity and completeness, it should say:\r\n\r\n   The M, V, Res, and C bits are as defined earlier for VCC One-to-one\r\n|  cell mode.

In particular, the entire ATM control word (the 3rd word\r\nin Figure 4) is optional, and *not* the various bit fields therein.\r\nTo properly reflect these requirements, the RFC should says instead:\r\n\r\n|  As shown above, in Figure 4, the optional ATM Control Word (if\r\n|  present) is inserted before the ATM service payload.

See Section 5.1.2 of this RFC, RFC 4385,\r\nand the recently published RFC 4928 for additional explanation!\r\n\r\n(a.3)\r\nThe 'Sequence Number' field is *not* optional in the control word,\r\nas erroneously might be deduced from the original version of the\r\nfigure; it MUST always be present; according to Section 5.1.2, only\r\nthe *processing* of this field is optional, and the reserved value 0\r\nis *not* a valid sequence number; it indicates non-use of sequence\r\nnumber processing.  Hence, the lower half of the ATM Control Word\r\neither contains a sequence number or 0.\r\n\r\n(10b)\r\nThe T bit explanation (in the lower half of page 27) contains\r\nmisleading and inappropriate wording related to Figure 4.\r\nFigure 4 generally applies for both the proper AAL5 CPCS-SDU payload\r\nor the case of an ATM OAM cell payload.  Furthermore, it should be\r\nnoted that Section 8.1 (which contains and explains Figure 4)\r\nspecifies the Flags field as 'reserved, should be set to 0'.\r\nThis is incompatible with the subsequent text that requires the T bit\r\nto be set to 1 for an OAM cell.  Therefore, to avoid confusion,\r\nthe clause referencing to Figure 4 should better be deleted from\r\nthe T bit explanation.\r\n\r\nHence, the text,\r\n\r\n       Bit (T) of the control word indicates whether the packet contains\r\n       an ATM admin cell or an AAL5 payload.  If T = 1, the packet\r\n|      contains an ATM admin cell, encapsulated according to the N-to-\r\n|      one cell relay encapsulation, Figure 4.  If not set, the PDU\r\n       contains an AAL5 payload.  The ability to transport an ATM cell\r\n       in the AAL5 SDU mode is intended to provide a means of enabling\r\n       administrative functionality over the AAL5 VCC (though it does\r\n       not endeavor to preserve user-cell and admin-cell\r\n       arrival/transport ordering).\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n       Bit (T) of the control word indicates whether the packet contains\r\n       an ATM admin cell or an AAL5 payload.  If T = 1, the packet\r\n|      contains an ATM admin cell.  If T = 0, the PDU contains an AAL5\r\n       payload.
