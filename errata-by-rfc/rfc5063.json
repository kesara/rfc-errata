    "orig_text": "(1)  Document title and Abstract\r\n\r\nOver the years, there have been arising different of flavors of RSVP.\r\nIn particular, RSVP-TE, based on the seminal RFC 3209, addresses\r\nquite distinct requirements than the original, QoS oriented, basic\r\nRSVP, and it follows a distinguished service model.\r\nIt has been good practice to clearly distinguish between RSVP-TE\r\nand the basic RSVP in the titles of RFCs published in the last\r\nyears.  Unfortunately, this has not been done for RFC 5063.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n  Some of the extensions to RSVP-TE published in RFC 3473, in\r\n  particular those reused and amended per RFC 5063, apparently\r\n  are not only applicable to GMPLS, but also to 'classical' MPLS /\r\n  MPLS Traffic Engineering.  The mentioning of 'GMPLS' in the\r\n  title of RFC 5063 therefore seems to unnecessarily narrow the\r\n  scope of the RFC.  The body of RFC 5063, e.g. the text in the\r\n  Introduction, seems to strongly support this point of view.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it might perhaps have been preferable to make the title\r\nof RFC 5063 (omitting the expansion of acronyms, anecdotally anyway\r\nonly performed partially in the published title):\r\n\r\n             Extensions to RSVP-TE Graceful Restart\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Abstract of the document should better talk about\r\nRSVP-TE than (pure) RSVP, in its first paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 1 -- word omission\r\n\r\nWithin Section 1 of RFC 5063, in the 4th paragraph on page 4,\r\nthe RFC says:\r\n\r\n                                  [...].  The downstream RSVP neighbor\r\n   can indicate its ability to send RecoveryPath messages by including\r\n|  the Capability object with the RecoveryPath Transmit Enabled set in\r\n   its Hello messages to the restarting node.  [...]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                                  [...].  The downstream RSVP neighbor\r\n   can indicate its ability to send RecoveryPath messages by including\r\n|  the Capability object with the RecoveryPath Transmit Enabled bit set\r\n   in its Hello messages to the restarting node.  [...]\r\n                                                                ^^^^\r\n\r\nNote: This correction is in accordance with the language used\r\n      in other places in the RFC, in particular the immediate\r\n      preceding sentence in the same paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Section 4.2 -- incomplete specification\r\n\r\nWithin Section 4.2, the artwork on page 6 depicting the Capability\r\nobject includes the RSVP object header and specifies the constant\r\nvalues applicable for the Class-Num and C-Type field.\r\nContrary to that, it does not specify the value of the Length field\r\n(that is equally constant for the new object) -- neither in the\r\ndiagram, nor does it supply explanatory text for that field (that\r\ncould have pointed to the fundamental specification and/or directly\r\nspecified the value).\r\nFor simplicity, I propose to correct the diagram.\r\nThe RFC says:\r\n\r\n   The format of a Capability object is:\r\n\r\n       0                   1                   2                   3\r\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|     |            Length             | Class-Num(134)|  C-Type  (1)  |\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n      |                         Reserved                        |T|R|S|\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completeness of the specification, the RFC should say:\r\n\r\n   The format of a Capability object is:\r\n\r\n       0                   1                   2                   3\r\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|     |           Length (8)          | Class-Num(134)|  C-Type  (1)  |\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n      |                         Reserved                        |T|R|S|\r\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)   Section 4.4.2 -- potentially misleading omission of article\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd-to-last paragraph of Section 4.4.2, on top of page 9\r\nRFC 5063 says:\r\n\r\n                                              [...].  If the restarting\r\n   node expects to recover RSVP state by the receipt and processing of\r\n|  RecoveryPath messages, it MUST follow procedures defined in Section\r\n   4.5.2, with the downstream RSVP neighbor.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                                              [...].

For the sake of\r\n  clarity and precision, the article should be supplied.\r\n\r\nThis issue recurs in subsequent parts of the text.\r\nSimilar corrections will be listed below in shorthand notation,\r\nreferring to this item.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Section 4.5.2.1 -- grammar / terminology\r\n\r\nOn page 11, at the end of the first paragraph of Section 4.5.2.1,\r\nthe RFC says:\r\n\r\n                                              [...].  If there is\r\n   resynchronized state and there is no MESSAGE_ID object or reliable\r\n   message delivery [RFC2961] is not supported, the node SHOULD send a\r\n|  trigger Path message, and, consider the message as processed.\r\n          ^\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n                                              [...].
