    "notes": "Given the description of packet number reconstruction in RFC9000 section 17.1 and the example in RFC9000 Appendix A3, the length of reconstructed packet number should be 32 bits, not 62 bits.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n The full packet number is 62 bits, although it is never expressed as such in the packet number field of the header. Hence, this errata is rejected.",
