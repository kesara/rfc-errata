    "notes": "Rationale:\r\n\r\nBCP 13, RFC 4288, has re-enforced the terminology from\r\nRFC 2045 ff.  The 'IM' in \"MIME\" stands for 'Internet Mail'.\r\nAs pointed out in RFC 4288, it makes no sense to remain stuck\r\nwith the colloquial abuse of language, talking about \"MIME types\",\r\nin particular when Media Types are used outside the scope of\r\nInternet Mail; the MGCP context is one specific example of\r\nsuch a scenario.  Hence, the RFC should use the terminology\r\nestablished in the IETF, as explained in RFC 4288.",
