[...]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n    Setting this object to 'unknown' will result in an 'inconsistentValue' error. [...]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is inconsistent with the value range for the EntityAdminState\r\n    TEXTUAL-CONVENTION describing the syntax of this object.\r\n    (Perhaps there's some history behind the scene.)\r\n\r\n(4) [typo/grammar]\r\n\r\nThe fourth paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause of the entStateOper\r\nOBJECT-TYPE, 10 text lines from the bottom of page 12, says:\r\n\r\n       A value of 'testing' means that entity currently being\r\n       tested and cannot therefore report whether it is\r\n       operational or not.\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps better say:\r\n                                                       vvvv\r\n       A value of 'testing' means that entity currently is\r\n       being tested and cannot therefore report whether it\r\n       is operational or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) [editing omission?]\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the entStateStandby OBJECT-TYPE, near\r\nmid-page 14, says:\r\n\r\n       Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the\r\n       remaining standby state values.  [...]\r\n       ^^^^^^^^^^\r\nPerhaps this text has been 'cloned' without full adaptation.\r\nSince, in this case, no possible value of the object has been\r\nexcluded by the text, the word \"remaining\" is inappropriate in\r\nthis context.  Therefore, this clause should better say:\r\n\r\n       Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the\r\n       standby state values.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) + (7)  [typo/grammar]\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of the DESCRIPTION clause of each of the\r\ntwo NOTIFICATION-TYPE declarations, near the bottom of page 14\r\nand near the top of page 15, contains the sentence:\r\n\r\n       The entity this notification refers can be identified by\r\n       extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the\r\n       variable bindings.  [...]\r\n\r\nPreferrably, this sentence should better say (in both instances):\r\n\r\n                                          vvvv\r\n       The entity this notification refers to can be identified\r\n       by extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the\r\n       variable bindings.
