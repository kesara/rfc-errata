    "notes": "The intent of this RFC is to treat the 32bit prefix as a number that provides uniqueness in the network (within the ASN). While it can be derived from the IPv4 /32 Loopback address, it causes confusion when routers are configured with no IPv4. It is better to suggest using router-id used by LDP for calculating the LSR identifier. How is router-id calculated is outside the scope of this document.`",
