    "orig_text": "(1)  Relationship to RFC 1773\r\n\r\nWhile studying RFC 4277, and re-reading its predecessor, RFC 1773,\r\nit became more and more unclear to me why RFC 1773 has not simply\r\nbeen declared being obsoleted by RFC 4277 - or perhaps being done\r\nso by RFC 4277 plus RFC 4276.\r\n\r\nAlmost all material contained in RFC 1773 has been expanded upon\r\nin RFC 4277; only a few historical noted have been dropped -\r\nwhich arguably are of no more interest from the point of view\r\nof current standardization and implementation efforts.\r\n\r\nHence, RFC 4277 apparently is a perfect replacement for RFC 1773,\r\nand it would have added to clarity about the status of the memos\r\nmaking this visible in the RFC index by means of a pair of\r\nrelated  OBSOLETED BY  and  OBSOLETES  notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Inconsistencies with References\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with References in RFC 4277:\r\n\r\n(2a)\r\n\r\nRFC 1965 had been obsoleted by RFC 3065, as noted in the text,\r\nand consistently, the Ref. [RFC1965] has been placed into the\r\nInformative References (Section 22.2), whereas [RFC3065] has\r\nbeen recorded as a Normative Reference.  That's pretty o.k.\r\n\r\nA similar relation exists between RFC 1966 and RFC 2796 (that\r\nhad obsoleted the former), and the text contains a similar,\r\nparallel treatment of this RFC pair as the pair noted above.\r\nNevertheless, the Ref. [RFC1966] has been placed in Section\r\n22.1, Normative References.\r\nThat seems to be inappropriate and inconsistent; [RFC1996]\r\nshould have been filed as an Informative Reference.\r\n\r\n(2b)\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of Section 3, on page 3, contains a citation to\r\n\"[BGP-MIB]\" that can be assumed from the context to mean RFC 4273,\r\nbut there's no such entry in Section 22 !\r\n\r\nConsistently with (2a) above, the Ref. [RFC1657] from Section 22.1\r\nshould better have been placed into Section 22.2, and instead of it,\r\na new entry [BGP-MIB] pointing to RFC 4273 inserted into the\r\nNormative References, Section 22.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following text might be considered for inclusion in an RFC\r\nErrata Note for RFC 4277 to resolve isuues (2a) and (2b):\r\n\r\n-----\r\nRFC 4271, in Section 22.1, \"Normative References\", on page 17,\r\ncontains entries labeled  '[RFC1966]'  and  '[RFC1657]' .\r\nThese entries should have been placed into Section 22.2,\r\n\"Informative References\", instead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, another entry should be added to Section 22.1 :\r\n\r\n   [BGP-MIB]   Haas, J., Ed. and S. Hares, Ed., \"Definitions of Managed\r\n               Objects for BGP-4\", RFC 4273, January 2006.\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  further errata (typos)\r\n\r\n(3a)\r\n\r\nThe example network topology diagram in Section 8, on mid-page 8,\r\n\r\n                     /---- transit B ----\\\r\n         end-customer                     transit A----\r\n                     /---- transit C ----\\\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n\r\n                     /---- transit B ----\\\r\n         end-customer                     transit A----\r\n                     \\---- transit C ----/\r\n\r\nRationale: cf. RFC 1773 !\r\n\r\n(3b)\r\n\r\nConforming to standard IPsec terminology, the first sentence\r\nin Section 17.2 of RFC 4277 (on page 14),\r\n\r\n                                    vvv\r\n   BGP can run over IPsec, either in a tunnel or in transport mode,\r\n   where the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]\r\n\r\nshould better say:\r\n                                           vvvvvv\r\n|  BGP can run over IPsec, either in tunnel mode or in transport mode,\r\n   where the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]\r\n\r\nor even, omitting that first 'mode' entirely,\r\n\r\n|  BGP can run over IPsec, either in tunnel or in transport mode, where\r\n   the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  [...]\r\n\r\n(3c)\r\n\r\nThe last sentence in Section 21 of RFC 4277, on page 16,\r\n\r\n   Finally, we'd like to think the IDR WG for general and specific input\r\n   that contributed to this document.\r\n\r\nshould say:\r\n                           v\r\n|  Finally, we'd like to thank the IDR WG for general and specific input\r\n   that contributed to this document.",
