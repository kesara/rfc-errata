    "notes": "Rationale:\r\n   DNS resource records (RRs) are always transferred as integral\r\n   entities in the DNS protocol, and IXFR is no exception for this\r\n   rule.  So there never are partial RRs in any IXFR response packets.\r\n   However, as indicated more precisely in the adjusted text above,\r\n   it is intended that partial _RRsets_ are carried in IXFR responses;\r\n   unchanged RRs are not sent inside incremental response messages.\r\nHistorical Note:\r\n   The above issue has been identified by the submitter in 2008,\r\n   but no Errata have been filed so far.
