That is, we don't believe errata should be used\r\nto update things that were true at the time of publication.  I think\r\nusing the errata in this way muddies the system. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, using Google search\r\non \"Craig Huegen\" returns a link to \"Index of Craig Huegen's\r\nDenial-of-Service papers and presentations\", which seems sufficient.\r\n\r\n",
