    "notes": "My understanding of this RFC suggests that in order to Advertize or Withdraw TAC , the bit E in TAC is used. In Point # 1 of section 2.3.2, it is mentioned that bit S is used. Looks this is Editorial mistake.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n I believe this errata is inaccurate. The S-bit is part of the \"Capability Parameter\" TLV as defined in RFC 5561 Section 3 and the TAE is the Targeted Application Capability that is defined in RFC8223. Section 2.3.2 is correct in stating that the S-bit of the TAC is set to 1. ",
