If the edit does not identify\r\n    any existing resource instance and the operation for the edit is not\r\n    \"create\", then the request MUST NOT be processed and a \"404 Not\r\n    Found\" error response MUST be sent by the server.",

    "notes": "As per the second paragraph of section 2.2 of RFC 8072, the operations are expected to mirror the semantics of the \"operation\" attribute described in Section 7.2 of [RFC6241].\r\n\r\nThe spec also doesn't specify what happens if it is a \"create\" operation and the resource already exists.  It should probably also state that \"400 Bad Request\" is returned.",
