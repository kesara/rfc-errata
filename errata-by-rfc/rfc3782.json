    "correct_text": "   When updating the Cumulative Acknowledgement field outside of\n   Fast Recovery, the \"recover\" state variable may also need to be\n   updated in order to continue to permit possible entry into Fast\n   Recovery (Section 3, step 1).  This issue arises when an update\n   of the Cumulative Acknowledgement field results in a sequence\n   wraparound that affects the ordering between the Cumulative\n   Acknowledgement field and the \"recover\" state variable.  Entry\n   into Fast Recovery is only possible when the Cumulative\n   Acknowledgment field covers more than the \"recover\" state variable.",
