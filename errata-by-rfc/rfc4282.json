One of the reasons was that RFC 1034 considers names without dots to be \"relative\" names of local significance. Such names may be valid DNS names for some other purposes than NAIs, though.  ",

Host software MUST support\r\n     this more liberal syntax.\"\r\n\r\nand continues saying:\r\n\r\n    \"Host software MUST handle host names of up to 63 characters\r\n     and SHOULD handle host names of up to 255 characters.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would have been strongly advisable to point out\r\non page 6 of RFC 4282, in Section 2.2, first bullet, that the\r\nnamed rules in RFC 2865 **DO NOT CONFORM** with STD 3 !!!\r\n\r\nNote: IMHO, it is a fundamental design flaw of RADIUS and certain\r\nother protocols using TLVs, AVPs, -- or however similar protocol\r\nobjects are named -- to specify that the 'length' information\r\n(being stored in a single octet) is to comprise the cumulative\r\nsize of the Type, Length and Value fields, instead of just giving\r\nthe size of the Value (payload) field; the latter solution would\r\nalways allow to fully exhaust the total range of an 8-bit unsigned\r\nLength and thereby allow payload octet strings of size 0..255 !\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, RFC 4282 ignores the standardization state of the\r\nproprietary historic tunnelling protocols that have served as\r\n'precursors with major deficiencies to learn from' for the\r\ndevelopment of L2TP, the only comparable protocol named in \r\nRFC 4282 that is on the IETF Standards Track.\r\n\r\n  o   L2F [RFC2341] has been published for information only\r\n      as a Historic RFC 'ab initio'.\r\n\r\n  o   PPTP [RFC2637] has purposely been rejected by the IETF --\r\n      because of its well known significant security flaws, among\r\n      other issues, and the Informational RFC 2637 has been\r\n      published with a very clear IESG Note to this end.\r\n\r\nI am surprised that a new Standards Track RFC is getting published\r\nthat repeatedly refers to obsolete protocols equally as to official\r\nprotocols, in a manner that does not make clear the distinction.\r\nThe continued unreflected use of PPTP, in particular, is seen by\r\nmajor security consultants as 'one of the most widespread trojan\r\nhorses' in the current Internet.
