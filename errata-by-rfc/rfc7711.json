    "orig_text": "The POSH client MUST NOT cache results (reference or fingerprints)\r\nindefinitely.  If the source domain returns a reference, the POSH\r\nclient MUST use the lower of the two \"expires\" values when\r\ndetermining how long to cache results (i.e., if the reference\r\n\"expires\" value is lower than the fingerprints \"expires\" value, honor\r\nthe reference \"expires\" value).  Once the POSH client considers the\r\nresults stale, it needs to perform the entire POSH operation again,\r\nstarting with the HTTPS GET request to the source domain.  The POSH\r\nclient MAY use a lower value than any provided in the \"expires\"\r\nmember(s), or not cache results at all.",
    "correct_text": "Add the following:\r\n\r\nIf the source returns an invalid reference, the POSH client SHALL NOT cache the results (reference or fingerprint) and SHALL perform the entire POSH operation again whenever performing any further retry.",
    "notes": "If reference is lost (eg x509 certificate) and if POSH client does not refresh fingerprint then it fails until expiration of old fingerprints... which will prevent the client to access a service because of caching, although references was updated on source domain.",
