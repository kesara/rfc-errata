The\r\n   direction set by RFC 3278 [CMSECC] is followed, but additional\r\n   message digest algorithms and additional elliptic curves are\r\n   employed.  [...]\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps better say:\r\n\r\n   This section specifies the conventions employed by implementations\r\n|  that support the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\r\n   The direction set by RFC 3278 [CMSECC] is followed, but additional\r\n   message digest algorithms and additional elliptic curves are\r\n   employed.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 4.3 -- imprecise text, danger of ambiguity / confusion\r\n\r\nIn Section 4.3, near the bottom of page 9, a new paragraph has been\r\ninserted in the part describing the [SEC1] KDF in general:\r\n\r\n   To generate a key-encryption key, one or more KM blocks are\r\n   generated, incrementing Counter appropriately, until enough material\r\n   has been generated.  The KM blocks are concatenated left to right:\r\n\r\n      KEK = KM ( counter=1 ) || KM ( counter=2 ) ...\r\n\r\n\r\nBut near the end of Section 4.3, on mid-page 10, the original text\r\nfrom the draft has been left unchanged:\r\n\r\n|  To generate a key-encryption key, one KM block is generated, with a\r\n   Counter value of 0x00000001:\r\n\r\n      KEK = KM ( 1 ) = Hash ( Z || Counter=1 || ECC-CMS-SharedInfo )\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two different, but very similar statements might well lead to\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated above, apparently the former text shall describe\r\nthe [SEC1] KDF in general, and the latter is intended to describe the\r\nrestricted particular use of that KDF in the context of S/MIME.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the RFC should perhaps better have stated, in place of\r\nthe latter text:\r\n\r\n                                   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\r\n|  To generate a key-encryption key for Suite B in S/MIME, one KM block\r\n   is generated, with a Counter value of 0x00000001:\r\n\r\n      KEK = KM ( 1 ) = Hash ( Z || Counter=1 || ECC-CMS-SharedInfo )\r\n\r\n________\r\nNote:\r\n It might have been even more suitable to have that text be moved up,\r\n making it part of the indented explanation of the 'Counter' element\r\n (2nd paragraph on page 10), where it could have been kept shorter:\r\n\r\n      Counter is a 32-bit unsigned number, represented in network byte\r\n      order.  Its initial value MUST be 0x00000001 for any key\r\n      derivation operation.  In Suite B, Security Level 1 and Security\r\n      Level 2, exactly one iteration is needed; the Counter is not\r\n|     incremented; i.e., one KM block is generated, with a Counter value\r\n|     of 0x00000001:\r\n|\r\n|        KEK = KM ( 1 ) = Hash ( Z || Counter=1 || ECC-CMS-SharedInfo )\r\n________\r\n\r\nAs a minimally invasive change, I recommend posting the above\r\nclarification (or any proper alternate text of your choice)\r\nas an RFC Errata Note.\r\n",
