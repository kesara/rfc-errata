    "notes": "Line 198 contains two spaces between \"\".\"\" and \"\"INBOX\"\" instead of one.  While I had the instinct to mark this as editorial, this sample server response, whose genesis appears to be RFC 5819, ended up in two IDs (which were corrected before they became RFCs) as well.  In any event, given that this response also violates the ABNF, and given the RFC Ed.'s guideline on ambiguity, I'm just marking it as technical.  I'll leave it to others more familiar with the practical issues for various implementers to make the final determination on how to label it.\r\n\r\n----- Verifier notes -----\r\nYes, this is an error: it comes from a combination of the RFC Editor style of double-spacing between sentences, the construction of the examples in XML in a manner that doesn't distinguish them from sentences, and the fact that it's nearly impossible to notice the situation when one is giving a final review.\r\n\r\nEditorial, though, because it's in examples.  The ABNF is the authoritative place, and that's correct.",
