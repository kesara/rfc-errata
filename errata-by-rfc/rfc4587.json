    "orig_text": "\r\n(1)  \"Updates\" relationship missing in RFC header & RFC index\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction (3rd paragraph on page 3) the RFC says:\r\n\r\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2032 and updates the \"video/h261\" media\r\n   type that was registered in RFC 3555.\r\n\r\nSimilar wording is in Section 6.1 (see below).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I expect that the RFC heading should have been amended\r\nby a \"Updates: 3555\" line, and that this relationship be visible in\r\nthe RFC index.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Misleading packetization specification\r\n\r\nOn page 4, in the first paragraph of Section 3.2, RFC 4587 says:\r\n\r\n   [..].  The 512-bit frames are then interlaced with an audio stream\r\n   and transmitted over px 64 kbps circuits according to specification\r\n   H.221 [H221].\r\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nFor clarity, it should say:\r\n\r\n   [..].  The 512-bit frames are then interlaced with an audio stream\r\n   and transmitted over p x 64 kbps circuits according to specification\r\n   H.221 [H221].\r\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n(and/or replace the 'x' by an asterisk, '*' !)\r\n\r\n(2')\r\nThe same issue recurs on page 15, in the first item of Section 11.1,\r\nthe Normative Reference, [H261] .\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Improper frequency specification\r\n\r\nAccording to the applicable ISO standards on Measures and Weights,\r\nthere is never a special sign to be written between the numeric value\r\nand the physical unit of any dimensioned physical value.\r\n(Preferrably, there should not even be any white space between.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, in Section 4.1 of RFC 4587, at the bottom of page 5,\r\nwhere the RFC says:\r\n\r\n         [...].  For H.261 video streams, the RTP timestamp is based on\r\n|    a 90-kHz clock.  This clock rate is a multiple of the natural H.261\r\n     frame rate (i.e., 30000/1001 or approximately 29.97 Hz).  [...]\r\n\r\nit in fact should say:\r\n\r\n         [...].  For H.261 video streams, the RTP timestamp is based on\r\n|    a 90 kHz clock.  This clock rate is a multiple of the natural H.261\r\n     frame rate (i.e., 30000/1001 or approximately 29.97 Hz).  [...]\r\n\r\n(Rigorous application of the above principles, taking 'bit' as a unit\r\nspecification, would also forbid data amount spellings like \"512-bit\"\r\nin item (2) above!)\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  misaligned 'ruler lines' above data format diagrams\r\n\r\nAccording to legacy and current RFC author guidelines, the ruler lines\r\nabove the two data format diagrams on page 6 (within Section 4.1):\r\n\r\n|      0                   1                   2                   3\r\n        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\nshould be indented as follows:\r\n\r\n|       0                   1                   2                   3\r\n        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  improper wording (2 instances)\r\n\r\nNear the top of page 7, the explanations for the (I) and (V) bits\r\nboth contain the sentence:\r\n\r\n                   vvvvvvv\r\n       [...].  The meaning of this bit should not be changed during the\r\n      course of the RTP session.\r\n\r\nThis is abuse of language.\r\nThe *meaning* of the bit -- i.e., the bit *values* -- is given in the\r\ntext preceding the quoted sentence, and thus intrinsically cannot be\r\nchanged during the course of the RTP session.\r\nWhat in fact should not be changed during the RTP session is the\r\n*value* of these bits!\r\n\r\nTherefore, the RFC should say (in both places):\r\n\r\n                   vvvvv\r\n|      [...].  The value of this bit should not be changed during the\r\n      course of the RTP session.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  typo\r\n\r\nIn Section 5, on page 9, the last sentence of the bullet (3) says:\r\n\r\n                                [...].  This mode is particularly\r\n        efficient in point-to-point connection or when the number of\r\n        decoders is low.\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                                [...].  This mode is particularly\r\n|       efficient in a point-to-point connection or when the number of\r\n        decoders is low.\r\n\r\nor:\r\n                                [...].  This mode is particularly\r\n|       efficient in point-to-point connections or when the number of\r\n        decoders is low.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  misleading section headlines\r\n\r\nIn the RFC text, Section\r\n\r\n  6.  IANA Considerations\r\n\r\ncontains the following sub-sections:\r\n\r\n  6.1.  Media Type Registrations\r\n\r\n  6.1.1.  Registration of MIME Media Type video/H261\r\n\r\n  6.2.  SDP Parameters\r\n\r\n  6.2.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model\r\n\r\nOnly Section 6.1[.1] contains information addressed to the IANA.\r\nTherefore, for clarity (and to avoid undue burden for the IANA),\r\nthe first two of the headlines quoted above should effectively be\r\nexchanged.  And, there is only one (1) registration!\r\nHence, singular should be used.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the text of Section 6.1 contains improper wording\r\nand has no trailing fullstop (dot) character:\r\n\r\n|  This section describes the media types and names associated with this\r\n|  payload format.  The section updates the previous registered version\r\n   in RFC 3555 [RFC3555].  This registration uses the template defined\r\n|  in RFC 4288 [RFC4288]\r\n\r\nThus, the headline\r\n\r\n6.  IANA Considerations\r\n\r\nshould be corrected to say, e.g.:\r\n\r\n6.  Media Type video/H261\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n6.1.  Media Type Registrations\r\n\r\n   [... paragraph quoted above ... ]\r\n\r\nshould be replaced by:\r\n\r\n6.1  IANA Considerations\r\n\r\n|  This section describes the media type and parameters associated with\r\n|  this payload format.  It updates the previous registered version in\r\n   RFC 3555 [RFC3555].  This registration uses the template defined\r\n|  in RFC 4288 [RFC4288].\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)  typo\r\n\r\nThe last sentence (of the last bullet) of Section 6.2, on page 12,\r\nsays:\r\n                                     [...].  These parameters are\r\n      expressed as a MIME media type string, in the form of as a\r\n      semicolon-separated list of parameters\r\n                                                           ^^^^\r\nIt should say:\r\n                                     [...].  These parameters are\r\n|     expressed as a MIME media type string, in the form of a\r\n      semicolon-separated list of parameters\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)  typo and misleading wording in Section 6.2.1\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 6.2.1, on page 12, says:\r\n\r\n   When H.261 is offered over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model\r\n   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be misunderstood as talking about an\r\n'SDP offer over RTP'.\r\nThe RFC should say instead (exchanging two pairs of words):\r\n\r\n   When H.261 over RTP is offered using SDP in an Offer/Answer model\r\n   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the paragraph with the headline \"Picture sizes and MPI\",\r\n\r\n   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture\r\n   interval (MPI) information for H.261 can be combined.  All picture\r\n   sizes may be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.\r\n   Using the recvonly or sendrev direction attribute, a terminal SHOULD\r\n   announce those picture sizes (with their MPIs) that it is willing to\r\n   receive.  For example, CIF=2 means that receiver can receive a CIF\r\n   picture and that the frame rate SHALL be less then 15 frames per\r\n   second.\r\n\r\nShould be corrected and clarified to say:\r\n\r\n   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture\r\n   interval (MPI) information for H.261 can be combined.  All picture\r\n   sizes may be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.\r\n|  Using the recvonly or sendrec direction attribute, a terminal SHOULD\r\n   announce those picture sizes (with their MPIs) that it is willing to\r\n|  receive.  For example, CIF=2 means that the SDP sender can receive a\r\n   CIF picture and that the frame rate SHALL be less then 15 frames per\r\n   second.\r\n\r\n(There is no 'sendrev' direction attribute, and it is important to\r\nexplicitely differentiate between senders and receivers of SDP and\r\nmedia, respectively!)\r\n\r\nFinally, the second paragraph on page 13,\r\n\r\n   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows CIF at 15\r\n   frames per second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D\r\n\r\nshould better say:\r\n\r\n|  An example of media representation in SDP is as follows:\r\n   CIF at 15 frames per second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D\r\n\r\nor, perhaps even better:\r\n\r\n|  An example of media representation in SDP, for CIF at 15 frames per\r\n|  second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D, is as follows:\r\n",
