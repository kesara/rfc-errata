    "orig_text": "(1)  Section 4 -- missing articles\r\n\r\nOn page 5 of RFC 4935, the last paragraph of Section 4 says:\r\n\r\n   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB\r\n   [RFC4439] and from T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [RFC4438].  It also imports\r\n   URLString from NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB [RFC2788].\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps better say:\r\n\r\n|  This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from the T11-TC-MIB\r\n|  [RFC4439] and from the T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [RFC4438].  It also\r\n|  imports URLString from the NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB [RFC2788].\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Section 5.3 -- typo\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of Section 5.3, on page 6, says:\r\n                                                          v\r\n|  With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instances of the\r\n   Fabric-related management instrumentation.  [...]\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n|  With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instance of the\r\n   Fabric-related management instrumentation.  [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Section 5.4 -- unspecific text\r\n\r\nSection 5.4, on top of page 7, says:\r\n\r\n   This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB\r\n|  module.\r\n\r\nIt should more specifically say, e.g.:\r\n\r\n   This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB\r\n|  module defined in Section 6.\r\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n(4)  Section 6\r\n\r\n\r\n(4a) improper use of term\r\n\r\nIn the DESCRIPTION clause of MODULE-IDENTITY invocation, in the first\r\nline on page 10, the term \"MIB\" should be replaced by the standards-\r\nconformant term \"MIB module\".\r\n\r\n\r\n(4b) missing article\r\n\r\nIn the DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FcsFabricDiscoveryTable OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration, on top of page 15, the RFC says:\r\n\r\n            \"This table contains control information for discovery\r\n            of Fabric configuration by switches.\r\n\r\nIt should better say:\r\n                                                         vvvv\r\n|           \"This table contains control information for the discovery\r\n            of Fabric configuration by switches.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4c) word replication\r\n\r\nIn the DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FcsFabricDiscoveryStart OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration, on mid-page 16, the RFC says:\r\n                                                              vvvvv\r\n                                     [...].  It is recommended that\r\n            whenever an instance of this object is set to 'start',\r\n|           that the desired range be specified at the same time by\r\n            ^^^^^\r\n            setting the corresponding instances of\r\n            t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow and\r\n            t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh.\r\n\r\nIt should better say:\r\n\r\n                                     [...].  It is recommended that\r\n            whenever an instance of this object is set to 'start',\r\n|           the desired range be specified at the same time by\r\n            setting the corresponding instances of\r\n            t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow and\r\n            t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4d) mis-specification\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FcsIeMgmtAddrListIndex OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration, at the bottom of page 21, says:\r\n\r\n            \"The management address list for this Interconnect Element.\r\n|           This object points to an entry in the\r\n            t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not true.  Cf. the corresponding description of the\r\nT11FcListIndexPointerOrZero TEXTUAL-CONVENTION and the description\r\nclauses for the t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable pointed to by this object.\r\nIn fact, this object points to a 'slice' in the\r\nt11FcsMgmtAddrListTable, namely the set of entries with common\r\nthird index equal to the value of the row instance of this object.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the RFC should say either:\r\n\r\n            \"The management address list for this Interconnect Element.\r\n|           This object points to a particular list in the\r\n            t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable.\"\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n            \"The management address list for this Interconnect Element.\r\n|           This object points to a set of entries in the\r\n            t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable.\"\r\n\r\nThis issue recurs.\r\nSimilar changes need to be applied to the occurrences of \"an entry\"\r\nin the DESCRIPTION clauses of the following OBJECT-TYPE declarations:\r\n\r\n(4e)\r\n  - t11FcsPortAttachPortNameIndex (at the bottom of page 25),\r\n\r\n(4f)\r\n  - t11FcsPlatformNodeNameListIndex (on page 30),  and\r\n\r\n(4g)\r\n  - t11FcsPlatformMgmtAddrListIndex (on page 30),\r\n\r\n\r\n(4h) insufficient / inappropriate specification\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FcsPlatformSysMgmtAddr OBJECT-TYPE\r\ndeclaration (on page 32) says:\r\n\r\n|           \"A list of management addresses for the platform.\"\r\n\r\nThis is misleading; taken literally, it would replicate precisely\r\nthe semantics specified for the t11FcsPlatformMgmtAddrListIndex\r\nobject (on page 30).  This cannot have been intended.\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect that the RFC should say instead:\r\n\r\n|           \"A list of management addresses for the hosting\r\n|            system of the platform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(4i) incomplete specification\r\n\r\nThe DESCRIPTION clause of the t11FcsDiscoveryCompleteNotify\r\nNOTIFICATION-TYPE declaration (near the bottom of page 40) says:\r\n\r\n            \"This notification is generated by the Fabric\r\n            Configuration Server on the completion of the\r\n            discovery of Fabrics in the range that has\r\n|           t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow at its low end.\"\r\n\r\nThis is incomplete and misleading;\r\nthe upper limit of the Fabric index needs to be specified as well.\r\n\r\nThus, the RFC should say:\r\n\r\n            \"This notification is generated by the Fabric\r\n            Configuration Server on the completion of the\r\n            discovery of Fabrics in the range that has\r\n|           t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow at its low end and\r\n|           t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh at its high end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIMHO, in particular the items (4a) and (4d) ... (4i) above\r\ndeserve being addressed by an appropriate RFC Errata Note.\r\n",
