Section 5.2 of RFC 8628 seems to refer to the steps of the device authorization flow during which the device code and the client identifier are exchanged for the access token (and the optional refresh token). \r\n\r\nAlternative correction:\r\n\r\n\"An attacker who guesses the device code would be able to potentially obtain the access token and the optional refresh token once the user completes the flow.\"",
