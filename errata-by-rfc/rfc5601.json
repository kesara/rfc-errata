Attachment to another PW will have no\r\n           PW specific entry in any of the service MIB modules.\r\n           This object may be modified only when the value of\r\n           the associated pwAdminStatus object is down(2), and\r\n           the associated pwOperStatus object has value down(2)\r\n           or notPresent(5) such that the row in the pwTable\r\n           represents an inactive PW.\"\r\n     DEFVAL { 0 }\r\n     ::= { pwEntry 10 }",
    "notes": "Description of the pwEntry object in the same RFC states that \"The read-create objects in this table are divided into\r\n           three categories:\r\n           1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation.\r\n              These are objects that define basic properties of the\r\n              PW (for example type, destination, etc.).\r\n           2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is\r\n              defined as not active.  A change of these objects involves\r\n              re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting.\r\n              PW not active is defined as one of the following\r\n              conditions:\r\n                  a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2).\r\n                  b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3).\r\n                  c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2).\r\n           If the operator needs to change one of the values for an\r\n           active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to\r\n           notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2).\r\n           Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting\r\n           the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus\r\n           to up(1) or testing(3), respectively.\r\n           3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time.\"\r\n\r\nIn further states (in tthe same description) that \"By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated in the individual object description.\"\r\n\r\npwAttachedPwIndex object is used to stitch a couple of PWs represented by two different rows in the pwTable, with the pwAttachedPwIndex value in the row representing one of them set to the pwIndex of the other one and vice versa.\r\nSince there is no way in the SMIv2 paradigm to create two rows in the same table\r\nin a single atomic operation, setting a this attribute in a pair of rows is only \r\npossible when both are created. In order to do that, read-create access mode of\r\nthe pwAttachedPwIndex object has to be interpreted as ability to set its value\r\nwhen the row represents an inactive PW. \r\nIn accordance with the quoted description, such an interpretation must be\r\nexplicitly specified in the description of this object.\r\n\r\nSuch a specification is missing in the current text, hence the default\r\ninterpretation of the read-create access mode is holds.\r\nProposed text fixes this problem.",
