The text seems to suggest a plaintext of size 2^32 is permitted, but the description of generation/verification of the AIV does not handle this case.\r\nAs written different implementations could disagree on what constitutes a valid ciphertext.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the simplest solution is to explicitly say the maximum plaintext length is 2^32-1 (which is still much larger than any intended use case, as this should be for encrypting keying material).",
