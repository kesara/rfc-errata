    "notes": "The original text uses the string identifier \"lunarNIC\" as the prefix for an example extension. This is inconsistent with the example given in Section 4.1, where \"lunarNIC_level_0\" is used as an example of a registered identifier for an RDAP extension. This inconsistency can lead implementers to believe that the registered identifier and the extension prefix can be inconsistent, when the intent of the specification is that they should be consistent. This inconsistency can cause significant misunderstanding of the technical specification and might result in faulty implementations if not corrected. Changing the examples in Section 2.1 aligns the text with the example in Section 4.1, demonstrating that the extension prefix and the registered identifier should be one and the same.",
