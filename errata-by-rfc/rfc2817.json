    "notes": "Since RFC 2817 was published, it has become harder to publish non-WG \r\ndocuments on the Standards Track. The \"IETF review\" policy is defined in \r\nRFC 5226 as:\r\n\r\n       IETF Review - (Formerly called \"IETF Consensus\" in\r\n             [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS]) New values are assigned only through\r\n             RFCs that have been shepherded through the IESG as AD-\r\n             Sponsored or IETF WG Documents [RFC3932] [RFC3978].  The\r\n             intention is that the document and proposed assignment will\r\n             be reviewed by the IESG and appropriate IETF WGs (or\r\n             experts, if suitable working groups no longer exist) to\r\n             ensure that the proposed assignment will not negatively\r\n             impact interoperability or otherwise extend IETF protocols\r\n             in an inappropriate or damaging manner.\r\n\r\n             To ensure adequate community review, such documents are\r\n             shepherded through the IESG as AD-sponsored (or WG)\r\n             documents with an IETF Last Call.\r\n\r\nwhich should address this nicely.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, overloading the \"Updates\" relation for specifications that \r\nuse a well-defined extension point plus an IANA registry is misleading.\r\n\r\nReviewed by the HTTPbis WG; see <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/170>",
