    "notes": "Original text mixes up terms \"ticket\" (as Session Resumption ticket from RFC5723) and \"token\" (as QCD token from this RFC). As QCD token must never be sent in an unprotected message (see section 9.2 from this RFC) it cannot be sent in the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange because this exchange is done in clear. So, QCD token must be sent in the IKE_AUTH exchange that immediately followes the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange. In this case there is no need for the separate INFORMATIONAL exchange the Initiator's QCD token (if any) to be sent in, because it could be sent in the same IKE_AUTH exchange.",
