But these lines are not listed as a possible sites of bare-LF line terminator. Which makes for an unnecessary parser exception and complicates possible request smuggling robustness between implementations.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThe difference was intentional. A chunked parser is not a start line or field parser (it is a message body parser) and it is supposed to be less forgiving because it does not have to retain backwards compatibility with 1.0 parsers.\r\n\r\nHence, bare LF around the chunk sizes would be invalid and should result in the connection being marked as invalid.\r\n\r\nIn any case, suggestions to further hardening of the chunked parser would have to be defined in that section, and would need to be achieved through a consensus document, not in an errata report.",
