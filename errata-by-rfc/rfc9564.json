    "notes": "Thank you for citing RFC6709. However, I have shown** that the concept of randomness is a fallacy - in fact, what we call \"randomness\" is nothing other than unpredictability by a Turing machine within a finite time. An LLM is subject to this same constraint like any other Turing machine program. I suspect that this observation shows that FLIP is a flop.\r\n\r\n** https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/groups/CDMTCS/researchreports/view-publication.php?selected-id=835",
