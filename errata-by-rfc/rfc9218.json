    "notes": "The very next paragraph indicates ASCENDING order of priority:\r\n\"The smaller the value, the higher the precedence.\"\r\nMinor nit: It is confusing and unnecessary to use \"precedence\" and \"urgency\" as aliases for \"priority\". Readers can be misled to think these are intended to be distinct properties rather than aliases.\r\n\r\n[AD response] The operative phrase to me is \"between 0 and 7 inclusive, in descending order of priority\".  I read that as a set of ordered values from 0 to 7 where the first value has the highest priority, the second value is down a notch, etc., hence, descending.  The later phrase \"The smaller the value, the higher the precedence\" affirms this interpretation.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   ",
