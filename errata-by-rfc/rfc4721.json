Yet these changes have not been performed consistently\r\nthroughout the memo.\r\n\r\nI have observed the following places where updates have been omitted:\r\n\r\n- Section 3.1, page 6, 4th paragraph:\r\n   \"(MN-AAA)\"  should say:  \"(Mobile-AAA)\"\r\n\r\n- Section 3.5, page 11, 3rd paragraph:\r\n   \"MN-AAA\"  should say:  \"Mobile-AAA\"\r\n\r\n- Section 11, last paragraph on page 16:\r\n   \"MN-AAA\"  should say:  \"Mobile-AAA\"\r\n\r\n- Section 11, first paragraph on page 17:\r\n   \"Mobile Node - Foreign Agent (MN-FA)\"  should say:  \"Mobile-Foreign\"\r\n\r\n- Appendix B, first line on page 22:\r\n\r\n     BAD_AUTHENTICATION\r\n  should say:\r\n     'mobile node failed authentication'\r\n\r\n- Appendix E, on page 24:\r\n\r\n     send_error(STALE_CHALLENGE)\r\n  should say:\r\n     send_error(stale_challenge)\r\n\r\n  and\r\n\r\n     send_error(UNKNOWN_CHALLENGE);\r\n  should say:\r\n     send_error(unknown_challenge);\r\n\r\nAlso, Appendix D makes repeated use of \"MN-FA Authentication\",\r\nbut that is not so closely related to the extension now named\r\ndifferently, and thus can perhaps be left unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  Section 11 -- logical grouping\r\n\r\nIn Section 11, the (new) final paragraph is an adjunct to the fourth\r\nindented paragraph (second paragraph on page 17) and should better\r\nhave been unified with that one; the new codes are already covered\r\nby the wording there!\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Appendix A -- typo\r\n\r\nIn the 7th bullet (onpage 20), \"compare to\" should say: \"compared to\" .\r\n",
