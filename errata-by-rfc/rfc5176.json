Here are some thoughts:\r\n1) Error-Cause is needed in Access-Reject (as is allowed by 3579)\r\n2) IANA should have procedures for defining new values (currently no procedure is defined). SDO need to be able to use Error-Cause to report back why an Authentication/Authorization failed.  Error-Cause seems to be the only solution other than Reply-Message which is not really designed for reporting error cause to the NAS.",

Changes from RFC 3576\" should be foreseen (just like the one related to Service-Type Attribute), such as:\r\no  Use of the Framed-IP-Address, Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix Attributes within a Disconnect-Request is prohibited\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, one thing that seems to me a bit unclear is that Attributes such as Framed-IP-Address, Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix are still valid session identifiers that could be present in CoA Requests, while they have been totally prohibited in Disconnect Requests ( even if they are mentioned as valid in section 3, end of page #10 ).\r\nFrom my point of view, either it's misplaced the example in section 7 or cardinality notation values in Disconnect Message Table of Attributes (related to the ones mentioned above) should be changed back to \"0-1\" (I personally think this last option would be better).\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nRejected.
