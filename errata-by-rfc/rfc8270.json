    "notes": "Instead of ignoring attacks, the administrator wants to know when one is taking place, particularly if it is an intense one which would lead to a denial of service, as suggested by the authors. Thus, using a rate-limited logging mechanism is an appropriate solution to keep records of the attack, and to notify the administrator in real-time then he can take actions if he wants to. As there might not be other ways to inform the administrator of an attack taking place, not logging at all is the last choice.",
