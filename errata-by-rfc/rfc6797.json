All subsequent navigations to \r\n    sub.example.com and its subdomains will be secure.\r\n\r\n    An attacker causes the victim's browser to navigate to \r\n    http://example.com. Because the HSTS policy applies only to \r\n    sub.example.com and its superdomain matches, this insecure \r\n    navigation is not blocked by the user agent.\r\n\r\n    The attacker intercepts this insecure request and returns a \r\n    response that sets a cookie on the entire domain tree using a \r\n    Set-Cookie header.\r\n\r\n    All subsequent requests to sub.example.com carry the injected\r\n    cookie, despite the use of HSTS.",
    "notes": "To mitigate this attack, HSTS-protected websites should perform a background fetch of a resource at the first-level domain. This resource should carry a HSTS header that will apply to the entire domain and all subdomains.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThis is a valid issue, but not suitable for the errata system.  The websec working group is discussing handling this with a short document to update RFC 6797.",

Yes, BUT at [RFC6797], Section 6.1 the \"overall reuqirements for directives\", Rule 3 defines:\r\n\r\n3.  Directive names are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\nAnd there is no other specification in Section 6.1.2 or has a IANA policy definition [RFC5226] like it is defined for additionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - That means the \"directive-name\" includeSubDomains is \"case-insensitive\"!\r\n\r\nThe \"case-sensitive\" camelized directive-name is misleading, because of many other definitions with \"-\", like seen in all examples or in Header Field itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n - to aware the clear understanding the \"directive definition\" in section 6.1.2 and ALL occurences needs to be renamend.\r\n\r\nthe minimum of renaming is \"includesubdomains\" OR \"INCLUDESUBDOMAINS\", but this is not readable anymore.\r\n- So it should be renamed like other valuless directives for Example the \"schemes-source's\" directives at \"Content-Security-Policy\", which means:\r\n\r\n\"include-sub-domains\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n\r\nNick",

If the server constantly sends a max-age of 7776000 and includeSubDomains is not changed (which is implicit in the example), then by 8.1 the cache\r\ninformation won't be updated.\r\n\r\nI believe that the desired implementation behavior is as described in 11.2, that is, UA must update the cached information, regardless of whether either of the max-age or includeSubDomains header field values are different from what is already maintained by the UA.",
