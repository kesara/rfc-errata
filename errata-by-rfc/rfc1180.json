All\r\nexample IP addresses in this tutorial are of type class C, meaning\r\nthat the upper 3 bits indicate that 21 bits are the network number\r\nand 8 bits are the host number.  This allows 2,097,152 class C\r\nnetworks up to 254 hosts on each network.",
    "correct_text": "The portions of the address that are used as network number and as\r\nhost number are defined by the netmask. All example IP addresses in\r\nthis tutorial are of type class C and have a netmask of 255.255.255.0,\r\nmeaning that the first three bytes (24 bits) represent the network\r\nnumber and the last eight bits the host number. This allows 16,777,216\r\nclass C networks with up to 254 hosts on each network.",
    "notes": "The concept of IP address loses much of its meaning if the value of the\r\nnetmask is ignored. The paragraph as originally written doesn't make\r\nsense, in particular \"the upper 3 bits indicate that 21 bits are the network\r\nnumber\".",
