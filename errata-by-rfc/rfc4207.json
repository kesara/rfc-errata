That is, only a single instance of the <TRACE> object is permitted on the <TraceMonitor Message> or any of the other messages. \r\n\r\nThe text in the various sections is factually correct when it says things like \"all the Trace Objects...\" However, this is misleading and should be changed to be singlular in all cases.",
