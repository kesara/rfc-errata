It has two purposes: (1) indicate that the TCP is prepared to\r\n   both send and receive window scaling, and (2) communicate the\r\n   exponent of a scale factor to be applied to its receive window.\r\n   Thus, a TCP that is prepared to scale windows SHOULD send the option,\r\n   even if its own scale factor is 1 and the exponent 0.  The scale\r\n   factor is limited to a power of two and encoded logarithmically, so\r\n   it may be implemented by binary shift operations.  The maximum scale\r\n   exponent is limited to 14 for a maximum permissible receive window\r\n   size of 1 GiB (2^(14+16)).\r\n",
