    "notes": "It seems to be a copy/paste error from the M.3100 Standard PC text. The comment in the MIB after \"lossOfRealTimel\" (Note also rogue \"l\" at the end!) clearly refers to the PC string \"reinitialized\" instead. It is strange how the integers have continued on from 158 instead of retaining the original values, but anyway, it appears to be a mismatch between the two standards. Ironically I noticed it when I saw that \"versionMismatch\" had different values (166 and 167).",
