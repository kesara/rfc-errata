    "notes": "On the picture, two spoke sites (“Spoke_Site1”, “Spoke_Site2”) are using the same VRF (“VRF_Spoke”) in PE1 router. For Hub and Spoke topology, it seems confusing. The spoke sites must not have a common routing table in the device and each spoke site must have its own VRF if there are more than one site using the same physical router.",
