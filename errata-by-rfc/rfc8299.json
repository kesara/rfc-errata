    "notes": "Submitter's comment:\r\n\r\nOn the picture, two spoke sites (“Spoke_Site1”, “Spoke_Site2”) are using the same VRF (“VRF_Spoke”) in PE1 router. For Hub and Spoke topology, it seems confusing. The spoke sites must not have a common routing table in the device and each spoke site must have its own VRF if there are more than one site using the same physical router.\r\n\r\nVerifier's comment:\r\n\r\nSubsequent discussion with the authors came to the conclusion that while the diagram is not technically wrong (for example, a single VRF could be used with policies to control inter-site communication), it would represent a very unusual configuration and therefore isn't a great choice as an example. The proposed replacement text represents the common deployment model and would be a better example.",
