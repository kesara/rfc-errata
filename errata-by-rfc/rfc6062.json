The effect is so bad that \r\n\r\nit may cause 97% call failure while using turn tcp behind nat.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nTo my understanding this errata is due to implementation limitation or error. One those systems I have knowledge of you can create a TCP connection outgoing from the same TCP port that you have a listener. ",
