    "orig_text": "(1)\r\n\r\nThere is a significant inconsistency in the newly introduced\r\nconformance information with respect to the new\r\n'dot1dStpPortPathCost32' object:\r\n\r\nThe  bridgeCompliance4188 MODULE-COMPLIANCE  macro\r\n(at the bottom of page 37 and the top of page 38) says:\r\n\r\n    GROUP   dot1dStpPortGroup2\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"Implementation of this group is mandatory for\r\n            bridges that support the Spanning Tree Protocol.\"\r\n\r\n    GROUP   dot1dStpPortGroup3\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"Implementation of this group is mandatory for bridges\r\n            that support the Spanning Tree Protocol and 32-bit path\r\n            costs.  In particular, this includes devices supporting\r\n            IEEE 802.1t and IEEE 802.1w.\"\r\n\r\nNow (see upper half of page 34), both dot1dStpPortGroup2 and\r\ndot1dStpPortGroup3 contain the object 'dot1dStpPortPathCost32'.\r\nThus the net result of the above text is that we have two\r\noverlapping but different requirements for that object, and\r\nthat the object 'dot1dStpPortPathCost' is not covered by\r\nthe bridgeCompliance4188 statement at all.\r\n\r\nBut, looking at the description clauses for dot1dStpPortPathCost\r\n(on top of page 22) and dot1dStpPortPathCost32 (on page 23)\r\nI conjecture that the original intent was to ALWAYS have\r\ndot1dStpPortPathCost instantiated in rows of the\r\ndot1dStpPortTable (as before, per RFC 1493), and to take\r\n(the new semantics of) the special (max.) value 65535 for\r\nthat object as an indication that dot1dStpPortPathCost32 has\r\nalso been instantiated in the respective row; therefore, I\r\nexpect that dot1dStpPortPathCost should be included in the\r\nconditionally mandatory groups named in bridgeCompliance4188.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to remedy this inconsistency would be to modify\r\nthe OBJECTS list of the OBJECT-GROUP dot1dStpPortGroup2 by\r\nreplacing 'dot1dStpPortPathCost32' by 'dot1dStpPortPathCost'.\r\nBut then the definition of dot1dStpPortGroup2 would-be-word\r\nby word identical to the definition of dot1dStpPortGroup (!)\r\nand it might be better to replace 'dot1dStpPortGroup' for\r\n'dot1dStpPortGroup2' on the first line of the text fragment\r\ncited above (bottom of page 37).\r\n\r\nPerhaps, an OBJECT clause mentioning the new semantics of the\r\nmax. value for dot1dStpPortPathCost in the past-RFC1493\r\ncontext migth be appropriate as well.\r\n\r\nI think that a correction is needed for this issue and would\r\nlike to receive your comment before formally submitting an\r\nerrata note to the RFC editor.\r\n\r\na) Replace:\r\n\r\n    dot1dTpPortInFrames OBJECT-TYPE\r\n        ...\r\n        DESCRIPTION\r\n           \"The number of frames that have been received by this\r\n            port from its segment.
