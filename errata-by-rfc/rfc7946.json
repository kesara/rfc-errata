    "notes": "This is only for the bullet point describing the right-hand rule for linear rings. It seems like the clockwise/counterclockwise descriptions are the opposite of the right-hand rule. Walking an exterior ring in a counterclockwise direction would have the exterior of the ring to the right of the observer.",
