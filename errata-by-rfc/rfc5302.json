    "notes": "Rationale:\r\nEach of the two restrictions mentioned in the initial part\r\nof the quoted paragraph indeed excludes 4 possibilities\r\nof the original set of 16 combinations.  However, these\r\nrestrictions are not exclusive; they overlap in one case,\r\nthus reducing the number of forbidden combinations to 7.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left with *9* different types of combinations.\r\n\r\nThis can also be seen from the subsequent list of 12 items\r\n(unfortunately, the numbering of these has been lost on the way\r\nfrom RFC 2966 to its successor).  That list contains 3 pairs of\r\nentries, i.e. 6 entries that contain the wording\r\n   \"These prefixes cannot be distinguished from ... routes.\" ,\r\nthus reducing the number of distinguishable cases from 12 to 9.\r\n\r\nVirtually restoring the list item numbering as (1) ...
